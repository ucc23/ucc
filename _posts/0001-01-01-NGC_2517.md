'Hullo, Rat!' said the Mole.<br>
'Would you like to come over?' enquired the Rat presently.<br>
'Oh, its all very well to TALK,' said the Mole, rather pettishly, he being new to a river and riverside life and its ways.<br>
The Rat said nothing, but stooped and unfastened a rope and hauled on it; then lightly stepped into a little boat which the Mole had not observed. It was painted blue outside and white within, and was just the size for two animals; and the Mole's whole heart went out to it at once, even though he did not yet fully understand its uses.
