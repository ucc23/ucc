Every database employed to generate the UCC is listed here, with a full description
of the modifications and corrections made before merging it in to our final catalogue.
The individual `csv` files con be found [here](https://github.com/ucc23/updt_UCC/tree/main/databases).

The original [UCC article](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stad2826) employed 32 articles, the rest where added after its
publication.

## Dambis 1999

[Space-age distribution of young open clusters and observational
selection](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999AstL...25....7D)

The [Vizier](https://vizier.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/VizieR?-source=J/PAZh/25/10) table lists 202 clusters.

Removed entries pointing to a GC: Lynga 7.

Changed names:

- NGC 1976 -> Trapezium
- van den Bergh 1 -> VDB 1
- vdB-Hagen 99 -> VDBH 99
- Pismis 6 --> NGC 2645, Pismis 6

Coordinates given by Vizier to Markarian 38 & 50 are wrong, fixed both.


## Dias et al. 2002

[New catalogue of optically visible open clusters and candidates](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002A%26A...389..871D/abstract)

The data was obtained from the [HEASARC archive](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/w3browse/all/openclust.html). Removed all entries with these
classes:

```
a = possible asterism/dust hole/star cloud (no cluster)
cr =  Cluster Remnant (Pavani and Bica 2007A&A...468..139P)
d = dubious, objects considered doubtful by the DSS images inspection
e = embedded open cluster (or cluster associated with nebulosity)
g = possible globular cluster
m = possible moving group
n = "non-existent NGC" (RNGC, Sulentic, 1979, Cat. VII/1). Some of Bica's POCRs (Possible Open Cluster Remnant, 2001A&A...366..827B) are also "non-existent NGC" objects.
nf =  objects not found in the DSS images inspection (wrong coordinates?)
o = possible OB association (or detached part of)
```

Converted `RA, DEC` columns to degrees.

FSR 1496 duplicated in lines 1015, 1016; removed 1016

These entries corresponded to a single entry in the UCC. Only one was kept, selected
according to the primary name in the UCC:

## Chen et al. 2003

[On the Galactic Disk Metallicity Distribution from Open Clusters. I. New Catalogs
and Abundance Gradient](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003AJ....125.1397C)

There are two tables listed in [Vizier](https://vizier.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/VizieR?-source=J/AJ/125/1397), Table 1 (119 rows) and 2 (144 rows),
with different columns and number of rows. I combined these tables into a single one
using the median for repeated `(GLON, GLAT)`  values and appending `[Fe/H]` values
when repeated (some are very different).

vdB 1 --> VDB 1

Added columns `(RA, DEC)`. Merged two entries that were present in both tables under
different names: 'Melotte 111, Coma Ber' and 'Melotte 22, Pleiades'. The final table
contains 216 entries.

Fixed the following `(GLON, GLAT)` coordinates manually because I suspect they are
incorrectly uploaded to Vizier:

Collinder 197: 261.7 +08.9 --> 261.7 +0.89
IC 1848      : 137.2 +00.1 --> 137.2 +1.00


## Koposov et al. 2008

[Automated search for Galactic star clusters in large multiband surveys. I. Discovery
of 15 new open clusters in the Galactic anticenter region](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008A%26A...486..771K/abstract)

Abstract: "_From this analysis, 15 overdensities were confirmed to be new open
clusters and the physical and structural parameters were determined for 12 of them_"

Results: "_We found that 11 stellar overdensities turn out to be new,
optically-visible clusters_"

Table 1 in the article lists 11 Koposov clusters and these are used here.

The remaining 4 clusters are listed in Table 2 as "new infrared embedded clusters"
with central coordinates only.


## Glushkova et al. 2010

[Automated search for star clusters in large multiband
surveys: II. Discovery and investigation of open clusters in the galactic plane](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010AstL...36...75G/)

"_We have found and verified 153 new clusters (...). Color excesses E(B-V ),
distance moduli and ages were determined for 130 new and 14 yet-unstudied known
clusters_"

"_All clusters from Table 1 having the other name according to Kronberger et
al. (2006) or Froebrich et al. (2007), are listed neither in the database of open
clusters (WEBDA) by Paunzen, Mermilliod (2009), nor in the catalog by Dias et
al. (2002). That is why we consider them as a new clusters._"

Table 1: 130 entries (new clusters)
Table 2: 23 entries (new embedded clusters)
Table 3: 14 entries (yet-unstudied clusters)

Total of 167 entries in the three tables.

The [Vizier](https://vizier.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/VizieR?-source=V/132) page lists 194 objects. Tables 1, 2 and 3 entries are present in Vizier
in its entirety. There are 27 extra entries in the Vizier table

The cluster `koposov41;fsr0839` presents RA coordinates that are substantially different
from those listed in the UCC for 'FSR 0839'.

- Koposov 41, FSR 839 (KOPOSOV2008): `(90.9917, 30.26139)`; converted from Table 2 in article
- FSR 0839 (UCC)                   : `(90.958 , 30.236)`
- koposov41;fsr0839 (this DB)      : `(97.7417, 30.2614)`

Since KOPOSOV2008 is previous to this article, I assume the RA coordinate is incorrect
here.

Merged the `Name` and `OtherName` columns into a single `Name` column.

The following entries have the following secondary names:

- koposov43 --> fsr0848
- koposov52 --> teutsch5

These names correspond to other entries in the UCC. Those two koposov entries are
related to similar alternative names in the UCC:

- koposov43 --> fsr0828
- koposov52 --> teutsch51

I correct this database to those alternative names.

Added VDBH to the BH entries.


## Borissova et al. 2011

[New Galactic star clusters discovered in the VVV survey](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011A%26A...532A.131B)

- Converted `RAJ2000, DEJ2000` in hms columns into degree values
- Added 'VVV-CL' naming with leading zeroes


## Kharchenko et al. 2012

[Global survey of star clusters in the Milky Way. I. The
pipeline and fundamental parameters in the second quadrant](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012A%26A...543A.156K)

Retrieved the data from the [HEASARC](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/mwsc.html) service selecting all clusters with
`class` equal to `OPEN STAR CLUSTER`, resulting in 2858 entries.

This DB lists the FSR clusters as "FSR XXXX" with leading zeros and the ESO
clusters as "ESO XXX-XX" with leading zeroes.

Name changes:

* vdBergh-Hagen --> VDBH per CDS recommendation (added 'vdBergh-Hagen' so that the
naming isn't lost)
* vdBergh       --> VDB per CDS recommendation (added 'vdBergh' so that the
naming isn't lost)

Removed entries pointing to a GC:

* ESO 456-29 (Gran 1)
* FSR 1716
* FSR 1758
* VDBH 140,vdBergh-Hagen 140

We do not use the values listed here to generate the (RA, DEC) positions for the
clusters, unless its the only place where they are listed.

The entries IC_1311 and Dolidze_2 are listed as separate objects and they are the
same object in the UCC. Removed Dolidze_2.

The entries FSR_1184 and Saurer_1 are listed as separate objects and they are the
same object in the UCC. Removed FSR_1184.



## Loktin & Popova 2017

[Updated version of the 'homogeneous catalog of open
cluster parameters'](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017AstBu..72..257L/abstract)

The [Vizier](https://vizier.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/VizieR-3?-source=J/other/AstBu/72.257/catalog) table contains 1052 clusters.

Many proper motion values in this DB are very wrong (see e.g: NGC 2516). We
thus do not use these values in the DB.

Contains 11 clusters with an extra name in parenthesis. These were fixed as
follows:

- "Alpha_Persei, Melotte 20"
- "Collinder258, Har5"
- "Coma Star, Melotte 111"
- "Herschel1, ASCC41"
- "Hyades, Melotte 25"
- "NGC2645, Pismis6"
- "NGC2682, Melotte 67"
- "NGC3247, Cr220"
- "Pleiades, Melotte 45"
- "Praesepe, NGC2632"
- "Stephenson1, Del_L"

Name changes:

- VDBergh_Hagen --> VDBH per CDS recommendation (added 'vdBergh-Hagen' to 43
clusters so that the naming isn't lost)
- VDBergh       --> VDB per CDS recommendation
- Sauer5 --> Saurer 5
- Teusch61 --> Teutsch61
- AlessiJ2327+55 --> Alessi J2327.0+55
- Sigma_Ori --> Sigma_Orionis

Removed entries pointing to a GC:

- berkeley42 (NGC 6749)
- lynga7 (BH 184)

Removed entries that are marked as duplicates in the UCC:

- Collinder 416 (duplicate of NGC 6882)
- Basel 9 (duplicate of Ruprecht 148)

The article says that: "_also includes our 48 newly discovered and
hitherto unknown poor open clusters_" but the CDS table lists 54 named 'LP_XX'
were XX goes from 01 to 55 (LP 03 is not present in the Vizier table). The last six
entries are named '50A, 51A, 52A, 53A, 54A, 55A' so these are probably from a previous
article.

These entries share naming convention (LP) with 
Liu & Pang (2019) presented their new OCs with no formal ID assigned (only numbers)


## Borissova et al. 2018

[New Galactic star clusters discovered in the disc area of the VVVX survey](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.481.3902B)

- Combined the tables `tablea1` and `tableb1`

The `Dist` column in Vizier is labeled as `kpc` but it contains clearly `pc` values.
The inverted parallaxes differ substantially from the distance values.


## Castro-Ginard et al. 2018

[A new method for unveiling open clusters in Gaia. New nearby open clusters confirmed
by DR2](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A%26A...618A..59C/abstract)

The [Vizier](https://vizier.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/VizieR?-source=J/A+A/618/A59) table contains 23 entries. No changes required.


## Angelo et al. 2019

[Investigating dynamical properties of evolved Galactic open clusters](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019A%26A...624A...8A/abstract)

The [Vizier](https://vizier.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/VizieR-3?-source=J/A%2bA/624/A8/table1) table contains 23 entries. No changes required.

Converted `RAJ2000, DEJ2000` in hms columns into degree values.

- ESO XXX-SCYY --> ESO XXX-YY


## Bica et al. 2019

[A Multi-band Catalog of 10978 Star Clusters, Associations,
and Candidates in the Milky Way](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019AJ....157...12B/abstract)

The [Vizier](https://vizier.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/VizieR-3?-source=J/AJ/157/12/table3) table contains 10978 entries. We keep only those with `Class1 OC` (open
cluster) or `OCC` (open cluster candidate). This reduces the list to 3564 entries.

Added `RA_ICRS` and `DE_ICRS` columns to the DB.

Fixes to duplicated entries:

* MWSC 2776, name listed twice --> removed one of the repeated names
* FSR 523, FSR 847, FSR 436 --> removed the duplicates that showed as single entries
* ESO 393-3 --> removed name from both entries (cluster not found in CDS)
* MWSC 1025, 1482, 948, 3123, 1997, 1840, 442, 1808, 2204: removed name from
both entries (clusters not found in KHARCHENKO12)
* ESO 97-2 --> removed from Loden 848 as it matches the position of Loden 894 according to CDS
* FSR 972, OCL 344, Collinder 384, FSR 179 --> removed from both entries, it does not show in CDS or anywhere else
* MWSC 206 --> removed entry that also showed FSR 60 as the coordinates for FSR 60 are a better match in KHARCHENKO12 for the entry with the single FSR 60 name

Changes to names:

* BH --> VDBH per CDS recommendation
* vdBergh  --> VDB per CDS recommendation
* FSR 429.MWSC 3667 --> FSR 429,MWSC 3667
* Carraro 1.MWSC 1829 --> Carraro 1,MWSC 1829
* Cernik 39 --> Czernik 39
* FSR343 --> FSR 343
* ESO456-13 --> ESO 456-13
* de Wit 1 --> Wit 1 (to match KHARCHENKO12)
* JS 1 --> Juchert-Saloran 1 (to match KHARCHENKO12)
* ESO 589-26,MW --> ESO 589-26
* Messineo 1,Cl 1813-18,SAI 126, --> Remove comma at the end
* Alessi J2327.6+5535 --> Alessi J2327.0+55
* TRSG 1 --> RSG 1
* Added 'Dol-Dzim 9' to 'DoDz 9' to match KHARCHENKO12
* Added 'Dol-Dzim 11' to 'DoDz 11' to match KHARCHENKO12
* Removed 'Alessi J0715.6-0722' as it is an OCC and its position matches that of 'Alessi J0715.6-0727'

Removed entries pointing to a GC:

* ESO 456-29,MWSC 2761 (Gran 1)
* ESO 93-8,MWSC 1932
* FSR 1758,MWSC 2617
* VDBH 140,vdBergh-Hagen 140,FSR 1632,MWSC 2071

#### Ryu clusters

This is the only DB that lists the [Ryu & Lee (2018)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...856..152R/abstract) clusters. The original
article claims to have found 721 new OCs (923 minus 202 embedded). BICA19 (page
11) says that the Ryu & Lee article lists 719 OCs (921 minus 202 embedded).
BICA19 lists in its Vizier table only 711 Ryu OCs, 4 of which are listed with
alternative names (Teutsch J1814.6-2814|Ryu 563, Quartet|Ryu 858,
GLIMPSE 70|Mercer 70|Ryu 273, LS 468|La Serena 468|Ryu 094). Hence there are
707 Ryu clusters in the final BICA19 Vizier table.

These are **very** small objects, Ryu & Lee (2018): "_The average angular radius of
the clusters is 1.3'. More specifically, 902 (98%) clusters are smaller than 3′,
and 823 (89%) clusters are even smaller than 2′._"


## Bossini et al. 2019

The [Vizier](https://vizier.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/VizieR?-source=J/A+A/623/A108) table lists 269 clusters.

Added VDBH to the BH entries.

Duplicates that were combined using their average values:

- ASCC124, Alessi37
- ASCC22, Ferrero11
- ASCC112, AlessiTeutsch11
- Harvard5, Collinder258

Renamed:

The [Vizier](https://vizier.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/VizieR?-source=J/MNRAS/483/5508) table contains 3 UFMG clusters and NGC 5999. This last cluster was
removed in the initial version of the DB (don't remember why).

Added `(RA_ICRS,DE_ICRS)` columns (converted from `h:m:s` and `d:m:s`).


## Liu & Pang 2019

[A Catalog of Newly Identified Star Clusters in Gaia DR2](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJS..245...32L/abstract)

The [Vizier](https://vizier.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/VizieR?-source=J/ApJS/245/32) table contains 76 clusters with no acronym given. Neither Table 1 nor
3 in Vizier assign and ID to the entries, only numbers. They do describe the ID columns
"Friend of Friend identifier". Also, in the article Table 1 lists the ID column as
'FoF ID'.

Added 'FoF_' to the entries' IDs. This also matches the HUNT23 denomination.

Added VDBH_ to the BH_ entries.

## Dias et al. 2021

[Updated parameters of 1743 open clusters based on Gaia DR2](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.504..356D)

The [Vizier](https://vizier.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/VizieR?-source=J/MNRAS/504/356) table contains 1743 clusters. This DB lists the FSR clusters as
"FSR_XXXX" with leading zeros and the ESO clusters as "ESO_XXX_XX" with leading zeroes.

The table lists 177 LIUPANG19 clusters because it includes clusters not listed as new
by the authors. Changed 'LP_' to 'FoF_' for consistency.
Removed the leading zero in 'FoF_XXXX'. Cluster 'LP_866' was duplicated (LP_0866),
removed the second entry. 

Changes to names:

* BH       --> VDBH per CDS recommendation
* vdBergh  --> VDB per CDS recommendation
* Sigma_Ori --> Sigma_Orionis

The `r50` column is listed with 'pc' units in Vizier, but it is degrees unit.
It also shows 4 clusters with very large `r50` values which could be listed
in pc units:

'Ruprecht 123' is listed twice as: 'Ruprecht_123_v0' & 'Ruprecht_123'. Removed
the 'Ruprecht_123_v0' entry as the RA value of the other entry was more similar
to the values listed in the UCC. The final number of entries is 2056.

[Improving the open cluster census. II. An all-sky cluster catalogue with Gaia DR3](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv230313424H/abstract)

The [Vizier](https://vizier.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/VizieR-3?-source=J/A%2bA/673/A114/clusters) table contains 7167 entries.

In the initial UCC version all the Theia entries were removed along with the moving
groups. In version **231105** the Theia entries labeled as OCs were re-incorporated.

A total of 157 HSC clusters have center values that do not align with the medians of
their members. Changed these centers to the members' medians. In **25/02/06**
the original (RA; DEC; GLON; GLAT) values were re-included in HUNT2023.csv (no changes
required to the main UCC catalogue so new version was generated).

Rounded float values in several columns.

Removed Teutsch 182 because it is listed along with UBC 6 and these are the same OC
according to BICA19. Also Teutsch 182 has wrong center coordinates.

Changes to names:

* BH --> VDBH per CDS recommendation
* vdBergh_ --> VDB_ per CDS recommendation

Removed entries pointing to a GC:

* Palomar 2, 7 (listed as IC_1276) 8, 10, 11, 12
* ESO_452-11 (listed as 1636-283)
* Pismis 26 (Ton 2)
* Lynga_7 (BH 184)
* HSC 2890, HSC 134 --> Gran 3 and 4

HSC 2605 has very similar coordinates and proper motions to globular NGC 5139 but its
parallax is different, so it was not removed.

Fixes:

* ESO_429-429 --> ESO_429-02 (according to CDS coords)
* CMa_2 --> CMa_02
* AH03_J0748+26.9 --> AH03_J0748-26.9

The [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/7603419) table lists 56 'LISC' clusters but only 35 are kept as "real" objects.
The parallax distances are in very bad agreement with the the estimated

at all. HUNT23 recovers 0% of these clusters.

The [Vizier](https://vizier.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/VizieR?-source=J/AJ/167/12) table lists 6413 entries. Removed all entries classified as 'g'
(globular clusters, 116 entries) or 'm' (moving group, 145 entries). Entries with
no `kind` info: Can-Battlo 1, UBC 92, UBC 93, UBC 94, UBC 95, UBC 96, UBC 97.

The DB contains now 6152 entries.

Removed entries pointing to a GC:

- IC 1276 (Palomar 7), 
- 1636-283 (ESO 452-11)
- Lynga 7 (BH 184)
- HSC 2890 and HSC 134 (located very close to Gran 3 and 4)

The DB contains now 6141 entries.

Changes to `Cluster` column:

- Replaced `_` with empty spaces
- Changed `vdbergh` for `VDB`

- Teutsch J1209.3+6120 --> Teutsch J1209.3-6120

This DB contains ~900 entries with large differences (>10 arcmin) in its `(ra, dec)`
center coordinates compared to the UCC's values (and/or large relative parallax
differences): 390 HSC, 208 Theia, 90 CWNU, 50 UPK, 26 OCSN, and others.

The author explains that their values com from the "_mean values of the member's
coordinates_".


#### The Teutsch 182 / UBC 6 cluster

This catalogue inherits the HUNT23 objects, thus it includes Teutsch 182 classified
as an open cluster. This object was removed from HUNT23 because it is the same cluster
as UBC 6 according to BICA19. The coordinates I could find for these clusters are:

- [BDCCT](http://www.astro.iag.usp.br/ocdb/file/BDCCT_Catalog_Alessi.txt) (_Bruno's Dirty Compilation of Clusterlike Things_, 2013)
  ```
  Teutsch 182
  (ra, dec)  = (22 56 20, +51 05 53) -> (344.083, 51.098)
  (lon, lat) = (105.167, -7.760)
  ```

- BICA19
  ```
  Teutsch 182 / UBC 6
  (ra, dec)  = (22 55 47  +59 11 05) -> (343.9458, 59.18472)
  (lon, lat) = (105.13, -7.63)
  ```
  Note that the (ra, dec) values do not match the (lon, lat) values.

- CASTRO18
  ```
  UBC 6
  (ra, dec)  = (343.9518, +51.199)
  (lon, lat) = (105.137, -7.633)
  ```

- CG2020
  ```
  UBC 6
  (ra, dec)  = (344.010, +51.187)
  (lon, lat) = (105.165, -7.660)
  ```

- HUNT23
  ```
  Teutsch 182
  (ra, dec)  = (343.7939, +59.225)
  UBC 6
  (ra, dec)  = (344.0718, +51.1448)
  ```
  Where the Teutsch 182 values appear to be inherited from BICA19

- CAVALLO24
  ```
  Teutsch_182
  (ra, dec) = (344.9286, +58.8156)
  UBC 6
  (ra, dec) = (343.9912, +51.1776)
  ```

**Summary:**

According to the 2013 BDCCT catalog, the UBC 6 coordinates in later catalogues
correspond to Teutsch 182.

BICA19 lists wrong (ra, dec) coordinates for Teutsch 182 and UBC 6, but correct
galactic coordinates, which it classifies as the same cluster.

HUNT23 apparently inherits the coordinates for Teutsch 182 from BICA19, and the
coordinates for UBC 6 from newer catalogues.

Hence, **we remove the Teutsch 182 entry from the catalog** because the UBC 6 entry
contains the correct coordinates and matches the fundamental parameter values listed
in other DBs.
