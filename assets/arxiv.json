      "title": "Spectral Evolution of Rotating Population III Stars",
      "summary": "  Population III (Pop III) stars, the first generation of stars formed from\nprimordial gas, played a fundamental role in shaping the early universe through\ntheir influence on cosmic reionization, early chemical enrichment, and the\nformation of the first galaxies. However, to date they have eluded direct\ndetection due to their short lifetimes and high redshifts. The launch of the\nJames Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revolutionized observational\ncapabilities, providing the opportunity to detect Pop~III stars via caustic\nlensing, where strong gravitational lensing magnifies individual stars to\nobservable levels. This prospect makes it compelling to develop accurate models\nfor their spectral characteristics to distinguish them from other stellar\npopulations. Previous studies have focused on computing the spectral properties\nof non-rotating, zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) Pop III stars. In this work, we\nexpand upon these efforts by incorporating the effects of stellar rotation and\npost-ZAMS evolution into spectral calculations. We use the JWST bands and\nmagnitude limits to identify the optimal observing conditions, both for\nisolated stars, as well as for small star clusters. We find that, while\nrotation does not appreciably change the observability at ZAMS, the subsequent\nevolution can significantly brighten the stars, making the most massive ones\npotentially visible with only moderate lensing.\n",

      "title": "The TYPHOON Stellar Population Synthesis Survey. II. Pushing Full\n  Spectral Fitting to the Limit in the Nearby Grand Design Barred Spiral M83",
      "summary": "  We apply population synthesis techniques to analyze TYPHOON long slit spectra\nof the starburst barred spiral galaxy M83. The analysis covers a central square\nof 5 arcmin side length. We determine the spatial distribution of dust through\nthe analysis of reddening and extinction, together with star formation rates,\nages, and metallicities of young and old stellar populations. For the first\ntime, a spatial one-to-one comparison of metallicities derived from\nfull-spectral fitting techniques with those obtained from individual young\nstellar probes has been carried out. The comparison with blue supergiant stars,\nyoung massive star clusters, and super star clusters shows a high degree of\nconcordance when wavelength coverage in the $B$-band is available. The\nmetallicity of the young population is supersolar and does not show a radial\nmetallicity gradient along the investigated part of the disk, in agreement with\nour chemical evolution model. However, a notable decrease in metallicity is\nobserved in a tightly confined region at the galaxy center, coinciding with\ncircumnuclear orbits. We attribute this to matter infall either from the\ncircumgalactic medium or a dwarf galaxy interloper or, alternatively, to\nAGN-interrupted chemical evolution. We confirm the presence of a dust cavity\nwith a diameter of 260~pc close to the galaxy center. Dust absorption and\nmolecular CO emission are spatially well correlated. We find an anticorrelation\nbetween R$_V$, the ratio of dust attenuation to reddening, and the emission\nstrength of molecular species present in photo-dissociation regions. We confirm\nour results by using alternative fitting algorithms and stellar libraries.\n",

      "summary": "  Young star clusters can inherit bulk rotation from the molecular clouds from\nwhich they have formed. This rotation can affect the long-term evolution of a\nstar cluster and its constituent stellar populations. In this study, we aim to\ncharacterize the effects of different degrees of initial rotation on star\nclusters with primordial binaries. The simulations are performed using\nNBODY6++GPU. We find that initial rotation strongly affects the early evolution\nof star clusters. Rapidly rotating clusters show angular momentum transport\nfrom the inner parts to the outskirts, resulting in a core collapse. Angular\nmomentum transport is accompanied by a highly elongated bar-like structure\nmorphology. The effects of bulk rotation are reduced on the timescale of\ntwo-body relaxation. Rotating and non-rotating clusters experience changes in\nthe direction of angular momentum near the dissolution and early evolution due\nto the tidal field, respectively. We present synthetic observations of\nsimulated clusters for comparison with future observations in filters of Gaia,\nCSST, and HST. This work shows the effects of bulk rotation on systems with\nprimordial binaries and could be used for the identification of rotation\nsignatures in observed open clusters.\n",

      "summary": "  The origin of supermassive black holes is an open question that has been\nexplored considering gas- and collision-based formation channels to explain the\nhigh number of quasars observed in the early Universe. According to numerical\nsimulations, supermassive stars can be formed in atomic cooling halos when\nprotostars reach accretion rates greater than $\\sim\n10^{-2}~\\mathrm{M_{\\odot}~yr^{-1}}$ and fragmentation is inhibited on parsec\nscales. It remains uncertain, however, whether fragmentation on smaller scales\nleads to the formation of a star cluster instead of a supermassive star in the\npresence of possible cooling mechanisms. We explored the formation of a central\nmassive object through collisions and the accretion of Population III stars in\na primordial gas cloud in a gravitationally unstable system by varying the gas\ntemperature and the degree of gravitational instability. We performed\nmultiphysics simulations in the AMUSE framework with a hydrodynamical gas\ntreatment through Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics and $N$-body dynamics for the\nprotostars represented through sink particles. Our results show that central\nmassive objects with masses $\\sim 10^4~\\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$ can be formed by\naccretion and collisions at different temperatures and that the most massive\nobject can reach efficiencies of $\\sim 0.61$ for atomic cooling conditions and\n$\\sim 0.95$ for more unstable conditions. We observe a quasi-disk formation for\nwarmer temperatures and a higher contribution through collisions to the mass of\na central massive object. Our results show that the embedded cluster is in a\nsupercompetitive accretion regime in which it obtains mass by accretion that is\nregulated by self-gravity. Our results suggest that in more unstable conditions\nwith lower gas temperatures, a more massive supermassive black hole seed can\nform.\n",

This work aims to determine precise and homogeneous\nmetallicities for a number of old ($\\geq$ 500 Myr) clusters from all-sky\ncatalogues of stellar parameters leveraging Gaia spectrophotometry. Our purpose\nwas to revisit the metallicity distribution of the oldest open clusters as a\nfunction of their Galactic position and age with improved statistics. Our\nsample includes ~600 old open clusters with a typical precision of 0.05 dex in\nmetallicity. We identified metal-poor or metal-rich clusters never studied\nbefore, as well as moving groups as the remnants of dissolving clusters.\nGalactic maps show a smooth decrease of metallicity from inside to outside the\ndisc. Metal-rich and metal-poor clusters exist at all ages but dominate\nrespectively in the inner and the outer disc, with different scale heights.The\nradial metallicity gradient was found to have a knee shape with a steep value\nof -0.084$\\pm$0.004 dex/kpc in the inner side and -0.018$\\pm$0.004 dex/kpc\noutside the knee. The inner radial gradient flattens with age. Vertically, the\nmetallicity gradient is -0.415$\\pm$0.030 dex/kpc. The large scatter in the\ndistribution of metallicity versus age is well explained by the superposition\nof OC populations standing at different Galactocentric distances, each with its\nown mean metallicity and small dispersion, less than 0.08 dex in radius bins of\n1 kpc.Our results are consistent with a negative radial metallicity gradient of\ninterstellar matter that was present in the disc when the clusters formed.

      "title": "Stellar-mass black holes in young massive and open stellar clusters --\n  VI. Role of external galactic field",
      "summary": "  Young massive clusters (YMC) and open clusters (OC) are widely considered as\npotential environments for assembling merging binary stellar-remnant black\nholes (BBH) via dynamical interactions. However, such moderate mass systems are\nsusceptible to being disrupted by the external tidal field of their host\ngalaxies, potentially limiting their effectiveness as GW sources. In this\nstudy, I investigate the formation of BBH mergers in tidally dissolving star\nclusters. This is achieved with a newly computed grid consisting of 95\nevolutionary model star clusters, where the clusters are subjected to a varying\nextent of tidal stripping. The cluster evolutions are computed with the direct\nN-body integrator NBODY7 that includes, among others, treatments for\npost-Newtonian (PN) effects in compact-binary members, mass loss due to stellar\nevolution, formation of stellar remnants, and tidal stripping. It is found that\neven strong tidal stripping does not quench the formation of a black hole (BH)\ncore inside a cluster or the formation of dynamical BBH mergers in the system.\nThe overall properties of BBH mergers, e.g., the form of the distribution of\nmerger delay time, primary mass, and mass ratio, and the redshift evolution of\nmerger rate are not significantly altered by the extent of tidal stripping of\nthe parent cluster population. Furthermore, even strongly tidally stripped\nclusters are capable of dynamically forming Gaia-BH-like detached\nBH--main-sequence-star binaries that escape into the galactic field.\nLimitations of the present study and potential future improvements are\ndiscussed.\n",

      "summary": "  It is unknown if an Oort cloud reaches its maximum mass within its star's\nbirth cluster or millions of years later. Complicating the Oort cloud evolution\nprocess is the fact that comets can be stripped from orbit due to perturbations\nfrom passing stars. We explore how a star's cluster escape time (t$_{ \\rm\nesc}$) and the time its Oort cloud reaches maximum mass (t$_{ \\rm max}$) affect\nthe Oort cloud's ability to survive via $N$-body simulations. In a 14\nM$_\\odot$/pc$^3$ cluster, we identify 50 stars of 1 M$_\\odot$ with a range of\nt$_{ \\rm esc}$ to host Oort clouds, each with 1000 comets at t$_{ \\rm max}$.\nFor each host, we consider Oort clouds that reach maximum mass 0, 50, and 250\nMyr after the cluster's formation. Each Oort cloud's evolution is simulated in\nthe cluster from t$_{ \\rm max}$ to t$_{ \\rm esc}$. Only a fraction of comets\ntend to remain in orbit, with this amount depending on t$_{ \\rm max}$ and t$_{\n\\rm esc}$. We observe that 12%, 22%, and 32% of Oort clouds with a t$_{ \\rm\nmax}$ of 0, 50 and 250 Myr retain >50% of their comets at t$_{ \\rm esc}$,\nrespectively. We find that the fraction of comets stripped has the\nrelationship, $\\rm f=m\\log_{10}(\\frac{t_{ \\rm esc}-t_{ \\rm max}}{Myr})$ where m\n= 0.32$\\pm$0.04, indicating that the longer the Oort cloud remains in the\ncluster, the more comets are stripped, with this fraction increasing\nlogarithmically at approximately the same rate for each t$_{ \\rm max}$.\n",

For recoil velocities up to $60\\%$ of the\ngalaxy escape velocity, the BRCs are detectable in mock photometric images at a\nEuclid-like resolution up to redshift $z \\sim 1.0$. By Monte Carlo sampling the\nobservability for different recoil directions and magnitudes, we predict that\nin $\\sim20\\%$ of instances the BRCs are photometrically detectable, most likely\nfor kicks with SMBH apocentres less than the galaxy effective radius.

      "summary": "  The Nuclear Stellar Disc (NSD) is a rotating, disc-like structure in the\nGalactic Center, believed to have a distinct star formation. However, its\nformation history and evolutionary links to other structures in the Galactic\nCenter remain uncertain. This study aims to present the first comprehensive\nchemical census of the NSD by deriving abundance trends for 18 elements in 9 M\ngiants in the metallicity range of -1.0 <[Fe/H]< 0.5. By comparing these trends\nwith those of other Galactic populations we seek to understand the chemical\nrelationships between these structures. We obtained high-resolution H- and\nK-band spectra of NSD stars using the IGRINS spectrometer mounted on the Gemini\nSouth telescope. The giants were analyzed consistently with stars from a\ncomparison populations to minimize systematic uncertainties. The abundance\ntrends of NSD stars exhibit similarities with those of the inner-bulge and\nNuclear Star Cluster (NSC) populations across a broad range of elements with\ndifferent chemical evolution histories. The trends for 17 elements align\nclosely with the local thick-disc behaviour at subsolar metallicities. At\nsuper-solar metallicities, most elements follow the NSC and inner-bulge trends.\nSodium is the only element exhibiting a distinct trend, with enhanced\nabundances in the NSD and NSC compared to both thin-disc and inner-bulge stars.\nThe chemical similarity suggests that the NSD likely shares an evolutionary\nhistory with the NSC and possibly the inner-disc sequence. Further studies are\nrequired to determine potential evolutionary links to Liller 1 and metal-rich\nglobular clusters. We find no evidence of typical globular cluster abundance\nsignatures in our NSD stars with subsolar metallicities. Our study demonstrates\nthe feasibility of obtaining high-quality abundance data even in highly\ndust-obscured regions of the Milky Way, paving the way for future surveys.\n",

      "summary": "  Context. Ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) are an intriguing population of\ngalaxies. Despite their dwarf-like stellar masses and low surface brightness,\nthey have large half-light radii and exhibit a diverse range of globular\ncluster (GC) populations. Some UDGs host many GCs while others have none,\nraising questions about the conditions under which star clusters (SC) form in\ndwarfs. GAMA526784, an isolated UDG with both an old stellar body and an\nextended star-forming (SF) front, including many young SCs, provides an\nexceptional case to explore the link between UDG evolution and star cluster\nformation. Aims. This study investigates the stellar populations, SCs, ionised\ngas, and kinematics of GAMA526784, focusing on its potential to form massive\nGCs and its connection to broader UDG formation scenarios. Methods. Imaging\nfrom HST and Subaru/HSC, alongside MUSE spectroscopy, were used to analyse the\ngalaxy's morphology, chemical composition, and kinematics. A combination of SED\nfitting and full spectral fitting was applied. Results. GAMA526784's central\nstellar body exhibits a low-metallicity ([M/H] ~ -1.0 dex) and an old age (~9.9\nGyr). The outskirts are much younger (~0.9 Gyr), but slightly more metal-poor\n([M/H] ~ -1.2 dex). The stellar kinematics show low velocity dispersions (~10\nkm/s) and a coherent rotational field, while the ionised gas exhibits higher\ndispersions (~50 km/s), a misaligned rotation axis (~20 deg) and localised SF,\nwhat could be suggestive of a recent interaction. The young SCs span ages of\n8-11 Myr and masses of log(M*/Mo)~5.0, while the old GCs have ~9 Gyr and\nstellar masses of log(M*/Mo)~5.5. Conclusions. GAMA526784's properties point to\ninteractions that triggered localised SF, leading to the formation of young\nSCs. Future observations of its molecular and neutral gas will help assess its\nenvironment, and the trigger of this SF episode.\n",
