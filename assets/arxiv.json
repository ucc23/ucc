      "title": "Dating N loud AGNs at high redshift: GS3073 as a snapshot of wCen like\n  evolution of a nuclear star cluster",
      "summary": "  In this paper we address two major questions raised by recent James Webb\nSpace Telescope observations of the young Universe, namely: 1) what are the\nseed initial masses, and how rapidly have supermassive black holes (BHs) with\nmasses of 1e6-1e8Msun grown in active galactic nuclei (AGN) hosted by very\nyoung galaxies? 2) What are the plausible explanations for the super solar\nabundances of nitrogen in a fraction of young galaxies at high redshift, both\nwith and without evidence of a massive central black hole? We focus mainly on\nthe system GS3073. This system shows an exceptionally large\nlog(N/O)=+0.42(+0.13/-0.10) in the gas close to the AGN. We show here that this\nabundance is consistent with the composition of gas ejected from massive\nasymptotic giant branch stars. Moreover, this system shows chemical properties\nmatching those expected at a specific point of the evolution of the abundances\nin the extreme populations of the former nuclear star cluster wCentauri (wCen).\nThis analogy, along with the N/O, C/O and Fe/O abundances in GS3073, lead to an\nestimate of an age range of 270-440 Myr for this object, much smaller than the\nredshift (z=5.5) age of about 1 Gyr. We also adopt the same criteria to\nestimate an age for GNz11. These two determinations constrain the BH mass\nversus age relation: accretion on the BH must proceed at intermittent\nsuperEddington rates in the first phases, and at a much lower rate after the\nfirst half gigayear of life of the Universe. The intermittency of accretion is\nalso a fundamental requirement to allow the formation of the extreme (N rich, O\ndepleted, He rich) populations today observed in wCen for a large range of\nmetallicities.\n",

      "title": "Is Earendel a Star Cluster?: Metal Poor Globular Cluster Progenitors at\n  $z\\sim6$",
      "summary": "  The strongly-lensed $z\\sim 6$ Sunrise galaxy offers an incredible opportunity\nto investigate star formation in the early universe on parsec or smaller\nscales. The highly magnified object Earendel within the Sunrise was previously\nidentified as a candidate star or binary due to size constraints placed by the\nlensing magnification, however recent works have suggested this constraint may\nbe relaxed to even the size of star clusters. Here, we explore the hypothesis\nthat Earendel may actually be a star cluster, and simultaneously evaluate other\nstar clusters within the host galaxy. Leveraging deep, archival James Webb\nSpace Telescope NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopy, we determine a spectroscopic\nredshift for the Sunrise galaxy $z=5.926 \\pm 0.013$, and we fit simple stellar\npopulation (SSP) models from three premier libraries to evaluate the physical\nparameters of Earendel and another distinct star cluster in the Sunrise dubbed\n`$1b$'. We find the rest-UV through optical continuum of Earendel to be\nwell-described by an SSP, nearly equivalently to $1b$ which is confidently a\nstar cluster. We infer they have intermediate ages $t_{\\rm age}\\sim\n30$--$150\\,$Myr, are metal poor ($Z_\\star\\lesssim10\\%\\,Z_\\odot$), and are\nconsistent with the formation age-metallicity trend seen in local globular\nclusters. Such intermediate age clusters are seldom probed spectroscopically in\nthe high redshift universe, and we explore the extent to which these clusters\ncan be characterized via the spectroscopic continuum.\n",

      "summary": "  In this study, the structural, astrophysical, kinematic, and Galactic orbital\nparameters of the open clusters Czernik 41 and NGC 1342, as well as their\ndynamical evolution, are investigated using CCD UBV photometry and Gaia data.\nBy applying the UPMASK algorithm to Gaia astrometric data for the estimation of\ncluster membership probabilities, we have determined that 382 stars in Czernik\n41 and 111 stars in NGC 1342 exhibit the highest statistical likelihood of\nbeing cluster members. Fundamental parameters (including reddening,\nmetallicity, distance, and age) were derived using both classical methods,\nwhere parameters are determined separately, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\nmethods, where parameters are estimated simultaneously. The results obtained\nfrom both approaches are in agreement, confirming the reliability of the\nderived parameters and demonstrating their robustness against potential\ndegeneracies. The distances to Czernik 41 and NGC 1342 were determined as\n2485$\\pm$151 pc and 645$\\pm$42 pc, respectively, while their ages were\nestimated to be 69$\\pm$10 Myr and 1000$\\pm$50 Myr. The metallicity values\n([Fe/H]) were found to be 0.07$\\pm$0.09 dex for Czernik 41 and -0.14$\\pm$0.07\ndex for NGC 1342. The stellar mass functions for both clusters were derived,\nyielding slopes of $\\Gamma$=1.67$\\pm$0.23 for Czernik 41 and $\\Gamma$\n=1.56$\\pm$0.41 for NGC 1342. Kinematic orbit analysis indicates that Czernik 41\noriginated within the Solar circle, whereas NGC 1342 formed outside it.\n",

      "title": "Centrally concentrated star formation in young clusters",
      "summary": "  The study of star cluster evolution necessitates modeling how their density\nprofiles develop from their natal gas distribution. Observational evidence\nindicates that many star clusters follow a Plummer density profile. However,\nmost studies have focused on the phase after gas ejection, neglecting the\ninfluence of gas on early dynamical evolution. We investigate the development\nof star clusters forming within gas clouds, particularly those with a centrally\nconcentrated gas profile. Simulations were conducted using the \\texttt{Torch}\nframework, integrating the \\texttt{FLASH} magnetohydrodynamics code into\n\\texttt{AMUSE}. This permits detailed modeling of star formation, stellar\nevolution, stellar dynamics, radiative transfer, and gas magnetohydrodynamics.\nWe study the collapse of centrally concentrated, turbulent spheres with a total\nmass of $2.5\\times 10^3\\, M_\\odot$, investigating the effects of varying\nnumerical resolution and star formation scenarios. The free-fall time is\nshorter at the center than at the edges of the cloud, with a minimum value of\n$0.55\\,\\mathrm{Myr}$. The key conclusions from this study are: (1) subclusters\ninitially form even in dense gas clouds; (2) the final stellar density profile\nis consistent with a Plummer profile, but more centrally concentrated than\nanalytically predicted; (3) gas collapses globally toward the center on the\ncentral free-fall time scale, contradicting the assumption in analytical models\nof local fragmentation and star formation; (4) hence, gas is predominantly\nejected from the innermost regions; and (5) the final value of the SFE depends\non the mass and formation time of the most massive star as well as the overall\nstar formation timescale.\n",

      "summary": "  Recent measurements of cosmogenic $^{10}$Be in deep-ocean ferromanganese\ncrusts from the Central and Northern Pacific have revealed an anomalous\nconcentration between 11.5 and 9.0 Myr ago, peaking at 10.1 Myr. One possible\nexplanation is a nearby supernova (SN) event. Motivated by this and by the\nproximity of the Solar System to the Orion star-forming region during that\nperiod, we estimate the probability that at least one SN occurred between the\nonset and peak of the anomaly. Using an open cluster catalog based on Gaia DR3,\nwe trace back the orbits of 2725 clusters and the Sun over the past 20 Myr and\ncompute the expected number of SN events. We find 19 clusters with a\nprobability greater than 1% each of producing at least one SN within 100 pc of\nthe Sun in the time interval 11.5-10.1 Myr ago. The total cumulative\nprobability exceeds zero at 35 pc from the Sun and increases rapidly with\ndistance, reaching 68% near 100 pc. Two young clusters dominate the SN\nprobability: ASCC 20 contributes most within 70 pc, while OCSN 61 becomes more\nsignificant beyond that distance. Our results support the plausibility of a SN\norigin for the $^{10}$Be anomaly and highlight the importance of additional\n$^{10}$Be records from independent terrestrial archives to determine whether\nthe anomaly is of astrophysical or terrestrial origin.\n",

      "summary": "  We present new JWST/NIRCam observations of the starburst irregular galaxy NGC\n4449, obtained in Cycle 1 as part of the Feedback in Emerging extrAgalactic\nStar clusTers (FEAST) program, which we use to investigate its resolved stellar\npopulations and their spatial distributions. NGC4449 NIR color-magnitude\ndiagrams reveal a broad range of stellar populations, spanning different\nevolutionary phases, from young main sequence stars, to old red giant branch\nstars and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. The analysis of their spatial\ndistributions shows that younger (< 10 Myr) populations form an S-shaped\ndistribution aligned with the galaxy's north-south axis, while stars aged 10 -\n60 Myr show shifting concentrations from the north to the south, consistent\nwith the possibility that external interactions or tidal effects may have\ntriggered star formation in spatially distinct bursts. Clusters of comparable\nages generally follow these distributions, suggesting that cluster and field\nstars form at the same pace in each galaxy region. Thanks to the unprecedented\nhigh-spatial resolution and sensitivity of the JWST data we recover a clear gap\nbetween Oxygen-rich and the carbon star branch of the AGB population and the\npresence of a massive AGB star \"finger\". The analysis of these stars can\nprovide constraints on AGB evolution models and dust production in this galaxy.\nThese results confirms NGC 4449 status as a compelling example of a local dwarf\nstarburst galaxy undergoing complex and possibly external driven star formation\nand underscore the power of JWST in probing the full lifecycle of stars in\nnearby starburst systems.\n",
