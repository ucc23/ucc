      "title": "The VISCACHA survey XIV. Chemical evolution history of the SMC: The\n  Southern Bridge Clusters",
      "summary": "  The chemical evolution history of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) is complex\nand is best understood through a comprehensive analysis of star clusters across\nits various regions. The VISCACHA survey aims to fully explain the chemical\nevolution of SMC star clusters by analyzing different sub-regions adopted from\nan existing framework. The west halo (WH) region, which contains the oldest and\nmost metal-poor stellar populations, exhibits a clear age-metallicity relation\n(AMR) with minimal dispersion. This region shows a significant dip of ~0.5 dex\nin metallicity approximately 6 Gyr ago. This was likely caused by a major\nmerger event that subsequently accelerated the star formation rate. Clusters in\nthe Southern Bridge (SB) and Northern Bridge regions of the SMC may have\nexperienced distinct chemical enrichment histories, as suggested by our\nprevious works but with limited data coverage. Furthermore, the AMR of\nwing/bridge (W/B) shows no sign of enrichment caused by the aforementioned\nmerger event, but exhibits signatures of the recent collisions between the\nclouds contemporaneous with the epochs of the Magellanic Stream and Bridge\nformations.\n  In this study, we present an updated AMR for the SB region based on a sample\nthat includes approximately 67% of its known clusters. Contrary to the\nexpectation of a very unique chemical evolution history, these SB clusters show\na trend similar to the one of the WH clusters. The chemical evolution models\nthat best fit the AMR trend of the SB clusters show excellent agreement with\nthe major merger model proposed for the WH clusters. Building on this, we\nsuggest a new unified chemical evolution model for both the WH and SB clusters,\nwhich can be explained by a major merger at ~6 Gyr followed by episodic\nchemical enrichment over time.\n",

      "title": "Resolving Black Hole Family Issues Among the Massive Ancestors of Very\n  High-Spin Gravitational-Wave Events Like GW231123",
      "summary": "  The latest detection of GW231123, a binary black hole (BH) merger with\nexceptionally large masses and high spins for the incoming components, has been\nsuggested as a smoking gun for hierarchical formation. In this scenario, a\nfirst generation of BHs resulting from collapsing stars form in a dense\nenvironment. Here they can assemble dynamically and undergo subsequent mergers.\nWe discuss three challenges for the formation of a GW231123-like event inside a\nstar cluster: 1) The high masses of the incoming BHs appear to be in the\npredicted pair-instability mass gap and thus suggest that second-generation or\nhigher-order generation BHs are involved. 2) Very high spins ($\\chi_f \\gtrsim\n0.8$) are very unlikely for dynamically assembled BHs because of the isotropic\ndistribution of spin vectors. 3) Hierarchically formed BHs are susceptible to\nreceive large recoils, which could kick them out of their cluster. We simulate\nthis scenario and show that only a few percent of mergers recover remnants\nwithin GW231123's primary spin estimate $\\chi_1=0.9^{+0.10}_{-0.19}$ and are\nretained inside typical star clusters. A large fraction of very rapidly\nspinning second-generation BHs (including $\\chi_f>0.9$) can only form if the\nfirst-generation BHs merges with aligned spins. This is a natural outcome of\nmassive binary star evolution scenarios, such as a chemically homogeneous\nevolution. This scenario also predicts equal masses for the components,\nimplying that the resulting BHs tend to receive very low recoil kicks and would\ntherefore likely be retained inside a cluster. We conclude that GW231123-like\nevents, if formed in a star cluster, could require first-generation BHs with\nlarge aligned spins that evolved through stellar binary interaction, followed\nby the dynamical assembly for a subsequent merger. We discuss the implications\nfor the uncertain lower edge of the putative mass gap 60-130 $\\rm M_\\odot$.\n",

      "title": "The VISCACHA Survey: XIII. The extended main-sequence turn-off in\n  intermediate-age low-mass clusters",
      "summary": "  The extended main-sequence turn-off (eMSTO) is a well-known feature observed\nin young and intermediate-age star clusters, characterized by a significant\nbroadening of the main-sequence turn-off region. Although prolonged star\nformation and stellar rotation have been proposed as possible explanations, no\nconsensus has yet been reached. Most previous studies have focused on high-mass\nclusters. In this work, we extend the analysis to the less-explored low-mass\nregime by investigating star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds using data from\nthe VISCACHA survey. We employed a widely used method to quantify the MSTO\nwidth in terms of age spread. Additionally, to validate our approach, we used a\ncluster also observed with HST. Our analysis confirms that the eMSTO phenomenon\nis also present in low-mass clusters, following the known age/mass-MSTO width\nrelations. In particular, the less massive cluster in our sample does not show\nan eMSTO, supporting the proposed link between the eMSTO and the escape\nvelocity of the cluster, providing a new lower limit to the age spread of\n$88\\pm40$ Myr for the presence of the eMSTO. The consistent MSTO width\nmeasurements between the VISCACHA and HST photometries confirm the robustness\nof our method and demonstrate that the age spread determination is independent\nof the photometric system, showing also the power of ground-based observations\nto investigate the eMSTO phenomenon.\n",

      "summary": "  Open clusters serve as important tools for accurately studying the chemical\nevolution of the Milky Way. By combining precise chemical data from\nhigh-resolution spectra with information on their distances and ages, we can\neffectively uncover the processes that have shaped our Galaxy. This study aims\nto derive NLTE atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances for approximately\none hundred giant stars across 33 open clusters with near-solar metallicity.\nThe clusters span a wide range of ages, enabling an assessment of the presence\nand extent of any age-related abundance gradients. In the Stellar Population\nAstrophysics (SPA) project, we acquired new high-resolution spectra of open\nclusters using the HARPS-N echelle spectrograph at the Telescopio Nazionale\nGalileo. We chemically characterized nine open clusters for the first time and\nreanalyzed previously studied SPA clusters, resulting in a consistent and\nhomogeneous sample. We determined NLTE atmospheric parameters using the\nequivalent width method and derived NLTE chemical abundances through spectral\nsynthesis for various elements, including alpha elements (Mg, Si, and Ti),\nlight odd-Z elements (Na, Al), iron-peak elements (Mn, Co, and Ni), and\nneutron-capture elements (Sr, Y, and Eu). Our findings are compared with the\nexisting literature, revealing good agreement. We examine the trends of [X/Fe]\nversus age, confirming previous observations and the enrichment patterns\npredicted by nucleosynthesis processes. Positive correlations with age are\npresent for Mg, Si, Ti, Al, Mn, Co, Ni, and Sr, while Na and Y and Eu show a\nnegative trend. This study emphasizes the significance of NLTE corrections and\nreinforces the utility of open clusters as tracers of Galactic chemical\nevolution. Furthermore, we provide a benchmark sample of NLTE abundances for\nupcoming open cluster surveys within large-scale projects such as 4MOST and\nWEAVE.\n",

      "title": "The impact of stellar rotations and binaries on the shape of upper main\n  sequence near turn off in open cluster NGC\\,6067",
      "summary": "  We present the analysis of the extended Main Sequence Turn-Off (eMSTO) in the\nopen cluster NGC\\,6067. We derive the projected rotational velocity,\n\\textit{v}sin\\textit{i}, of the stars belonging to the eMSTO region of the main\nsequence (MS) utilizing \\textit{Gaia}-ESO spectra. Our results reveal a\npositive correlation between \\textit{v}sin\\textit{i} and the color of eMSTO\nstars, where fast-rotating stars predominantly occupy the red part of the MS\nwhile slow-rotating ones prefer a bluer side of the MS. The gravity-darkening\neffect might be a reason for this correlation. We find that most of the close\nbinaries present in the eMSTO population would be slow-rotating due to the\ntidal-locking phenomenon. We identify four double-lined spectroscopic binaries\n(SB2) featuring slow-rotating companions, further supporting this tidal-locking\nhypothesis. However, the spatial distribution and the cumulative radial\ndistribution indicate a higher concentration of red eMSTO stars in the\ncluster's central region than their bluer counterparts. This suggests that\ntidal locking is less likely to be the cause of the observed spread in rotation\nrates among eMSTO stars. Instead, we propose that star-disk interactions during\nthe pre-main-sequence phase might have played a crucial role in spreading the\nrotation rates of stars, leading to the eMSTO phenomenon in NGC\\,6067.\n",

      "title": "The dynamical evolution of the stellar clumps in the Sparkler galaxy",
      "summary": "  Recent JWST observations detected stellar clumps around the z=1.4\ngravitationally lensed Sparkler galaxy (of stellar mass $M_*\\sim\n10^9\\,\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$), with ages and metallicities compatible with globular\nclusters (GCs). However, most of their masses ($>10^6\\,\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$) and\nsizes (>30 pc) are about 10 times those of GCs in the local Universe. To assess\nwhether these clumps can evolve into GCs, we performed N-body simulations of\ntheir dynamical evolution from z=1.4 to z=0 (9.23 Gyr), under the effect of\ndynamical friction and tidal stripping. Dynamical friction is studied\nperforming multiple runs of a clump system in a Sparkler-like spherical halo of\nmass $M_{200}\\simeq 5\\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ (from the\nstellar-to-halo mass relation). For the tidal stripping, we simulated resolved\nclumps, orbiting in an external, static gravitational potential including the\nsame halo as in the dynamical friction simulations and also a Sparkler-like\nstellar disk. Dynamical friction causes the clumps with mass\n$>10^7\\,\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ to sink into the galaxy central regions, possibly\ncontributing to the bulge growth. In absence of tidal stripping, the mass\ndistribution of the surviving clumps (40%) peaks at $5\\times\n10^6\\,\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$, implying the presence of uncommonly over-massive\nclumps at z=0. Tidal shocks by the stellar disk strip considerable mass from\nlow-mass clumps, even though their sizes remain larger than those of\npresent-day GCs. When the surviving clumps are corrected for tidal stripping,\ntheir mass distribution peak shifts to $2\\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$,\ncompatible with massive GCs. Our simulations suggest that a fraction of the\nSparkler clumps is expected to fall into the central regions, where they might\nbecome bulge fossil fragments or contribute to form a nuclear star cluster. The\nremaining clumps are too large in size to be progenitors of GCs.\n",

This spiral disk galaxy has apparently had a mostly\nquiescent existence, although recent discoveries, particularly of a pronounced\nwarp in the gas and stellar disk, suggest that M33's relatively quiet past was\ninterrupted at least once by a dynamical interaction with another galaxy. We\nsuggest that this sub population provides evidence of accretion of one or more\ndwarf galaxies in M33's history. We estimate a lower limit for the accreted\nhalo virial mass of $M_{\\rm vir} \\sim (7 \\pm 3) \\times 10^{10}$\\msun,\naccounting for about 10\\% of the virial mass in the halo of M33 that has an\naccretion origin.

      "title": "The Star Formation History and Evolution of the Ultra-Diffuse M81\n  Satellite, F8D1",
      "summary": "  We present deep HST imaging of one of the nearest ultra-diffuse galaxies\n(UDGs) outside of the Local Group: F8D1, a satellite of M81 known to be tidally\ndisrupting. UDGs are an enigmatic and diverse population, with evolutionary\npathways ranging from tidal processing to bursty feedback and high initial\nangular momentum. To determine F8D1's evolutionary drivers, we resolve stars in\nF8D1's central $\\sim$1 kpc and in a parallel field $\\sim$6 kpc along its major\naxis to deep photometric limits, reaching below the Red Clump. We also image\neight shallower fields along F8D1's major and minor axes. We calculate the star\nformation history (SFH) in the two deep fields, finding that while currently\nquiescent, both regions experienced a substantial burst $\\sim$2 Gyr ago and a\nsmaller burst $\\sim$500 Myr ago, which likely formed F8D1's nuclear star\ncluster. In the shallow fields, using the ratio of evolved Asymptotic Giant\nBranch and Red Giant Branch stars out to $\\sim$13 kpc along F8D1's known\nstellar stream, we confirm that F8D1 was globally star-forming until at least 2\nGyr ago. We estimate a total progenitor stellar mass, including the stream, of\n$\\sim$1.3$\\times$10$^8\\ M_{\\odot}$, with an average [M/H] $\\sim$ $-$0.8. We\ncompare F8D1's properties to those of Local Group galaxies with similar initial\nstellar mass. We find that F8D1 is consistent with a progenitor star-forming\ngalaxy similar to NGC 6822, which is in the midst of a transition to a\nSagittarius-like system. Notably, this evolutionary sequence can be\naccomplished through tidal processing alone, in galaxies that have experienced\nsufficiently bursty feedback to create cored profiles.\n",

      "title": "Unraveling the Feedback-Regulated Star Formation Activities around the\n  Expanding Galactic MIR Bubble [HKS2019] E71",
      "summary": "  We explore the physical environment of the Galactic mid-infrared (MIR) bubble\n[HKS2019] E71 (hereafter E71) through a multi-wavelength approach. E71 is\nlocated at the edge of a filamentary structure, as traced in Herschel images\n(250-500 $\\mu$m), Herschel column density map, and molecular maps in the\nvelocity range [-20,-14] km/s. It hosts a stellar cluster (radius~1.26 pc,\ndistance~1.81+/-0.15 kpc) associated with radio continuum emission, including a\ncentrally positioned B1.5-type massive star (hereafter 'm2'), along with an\nenhanced population of evolved low-mass stars and young stellar objects. MIR\nimages and molecular line maps reveal a PDR surrounding 'm2', exhibiting an\narc-like structure along the edges of E71. Regularly spaced molecular and dust\ncondensations are identified along this structure. The position-velocity map of\n12CO emission suggests an expansion of molecular gas concentrated at the\nperiphery of E71. Near-infrared spectroscopic observations with TANSPEC confirm\nthe presence of the accretion process in a massive young stellar object (MYSO)\nlocated near the edge of the bubble. High-resolution uGMRT radio continuum maps\nuncover substructures in the ionized emission, both toward the MYSO and the\ncenter of E71. These findings support that 'm2' has shaped an arc-like\nmorphology through its feedback processes. The pressure exerted by 'm2' and the\nvelocity structure of the 12/13CO(1-0) emission suggest that the stellar\nfeedback has likely driven out molecular material, leading to the formation of\nthe expanding E71 bubble. Our overall investigation infers that the \"collect\nand collapse\" process might be a possible mechanism that can describe the\nongoing star formation activities around the E71 bubble.\n",

      "summary": "  We aim to identify the cluster members, estimate cluster properties, study\nthe dynamical state of the clusters as a function of mass, trace the existence\nof dynamical effects in massive stars, and check for spatial patterns of\nmembers in young clusters. We studied 14 young open clusters located within 1\nkpc using the data from Gaia DR3 with the membership estimated using the GMM\nmethod. The cluster parameters such as age, distance, metallicity, and\nextinction were estimated by fitting PARSEC isochrones to the CMDs. These\nclusters are found to have ages between 6-90 Myr, located between 334-910 pc,\ncovering a mass range, of 0.13 to 13.77 solar mass. In five of these clusters,\nstars from F to M spectral type show increasing velocity dispersion, a\nsignature for dynamical relaxation. We detect high proper motion for B and\nA-type stars, possible walkaway stars in the other five clusters, Alessi\nTeutsch 5, ASCC 16, ASCC 21, IC 2395, and NGC 6405. We demonstrate the\nexistence of mass-dependent velocity dispersion in young clusters suggestive of\ndynamical relaxation. The typical range of transverse velocity dispersion is\nfound to be 0.40 - 0.70 km/s for young clusters.\n",

      "summary": "  Context. Young Massive Star Clusters, long considered as potentially\nimportant sources of galactic cosmic rays, have recently emerged as gamma-ray\nemitters up to very high energies. Aims. In order to quantify the contribution\nof this source class to the pool of Galactic CRs, we need to estimate the\ntypical acceleration efficiency of these systems. Methods. We search for\nemission in the GeV band, as most of the energy is emitted in this band. We\nperform an analysis of Fermi-LAT data collected towards the M16 region, a\nstar-forming region also known as the Eagle Nebula, which hosts the Young\nMassive Star Cluster NGC 6611. We model the acceleration at the stellar wind\ntermination shock and the propagation through the wind-blown bubble to derive\nthe energetics of the process and interpret the GeV observations. Results. We\nfind significant GeV emission in correspondence of a molecular cloud associated\nto the Young Massive Star Cluster NGC 6611. We interpret this as hadronic\nemission associated to particle accelerated at the cluster wind termination\nshock and propagated through the low-density wind-excavated bubble to the\ncloud. Our modeling allows us to put firm constraints on the acceleration\nefficiency in NGC 6611, assessing it between $\\sim$ 1 % and $\\sim$ 4 %.\n",

      "title": "Bar-driven Streaming Motions Mimic a Massive Bulge in the Inner Milky\n  Way",
      "summary": "  The circular speed curve of the Milky Way provides a key constraint on its\nmass distribution, reflecting the axisymmetric component of the gravitational\npotential. This is especially critical in the inner Galaxy ($R \\lesssim 4$\nkpc), where non-axisymmetric structures such as the stellar bar and nuclear\nstellar disk strongly influence dynamics. However, significant discrepancies\nremain between circular speed curves inferred from stellar dynamical modeling\nand those derived from the terminal-velocity method applied to gas kinematics.\nTo investigate this, we perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations\nincluding cooling, heating, star formation, and feedback, under a realistic\ngravitational potential derived from stellar dynamical models calibrated to\nobservational data. This potential includes the Galactic bar, stellar disks,\ndark matter halo, nuclear stellar disk, and nuclear star cluster. We generate\nsynthetic longitude-velocity ($l$-$v$) diagrams and apply the terminal-velocity\nmethod to derive circular speeds. The simulated gas reproduces the observed\nterminal-velocity envelope, including a steep inner rise. We find this feature\narises from bar-driven non-circular motions, which cause the terminal-velocity\nmethod to overestimate circular speeds by up to a factor of 2 at $R \\sim 0.4$\nkpc, and enclosed mass by up to a factor of 4. These results suggest that inner\ngas-based rotation curves can significantly overestimate central mass\nconcentrations. The steep inner rise in gas-derived circular speeds does not\nrequire a massive classical bulge but can be explained by bar-induced streaming\nmotions. Rather than proposing a new mechanism, our study provides a clear,\nMilky Way-specific demonstration of this effect, emphasizing the importance of\ndynamical modeling that explicitly includes non-circular motions for accurate\nmass inference in the inner Milky Way.\n",
