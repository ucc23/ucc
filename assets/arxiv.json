      "title": "Wind-fed Supermassive Black Hole Accretion by the Nuclear Star Cluster:\n  the Case of M31*",
      "summary": "  The central supermassive black hole (SMBH) of the Andromeda galaxy, known as\nM31*, exhibits dim electromagnetic emission and is inferred to have an\nextremely low accretion rate for its remarkable mass ($\\sim10^8~\\rm~M_\\odot$).\nIn this work, we use three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations to explore a\npreviously untested scenario, in which M31* is fed by the collective stellar\nmass-loss from its surrounding nuclear star cluster, manifested as a famous\neccentric disk of predominantly old stellar populations. The stellar mass-loss\nis assumed to be dominated by the slow and cold winds from 100 asymptotic\ngiant-branch stars, which follow well-constrained Keplerian orbits around M31*\nand together provide a mass injection rate of\n$\\sim4\\times10^{-5}\\rm~M_\\odot~yr^{-1}$. The simulations achieve a quasi-steady\nstate on a Myr timescale, at which point a quasi-Keplerian, cool\n($T\\sim10^3-10^4~\\rm K$) gas disk extending several parsecs is established.\nThis disk is continuously supplied by the stellar winds and itself feeds the\ncentral SMBH. At the end of the simulations at 2 Myr, an accretion rate of\n$\\sim2\\times10^{-5}\\rm~M_\\odot~yr^{-1}$ is found but could vary by a factor of\nfew depending on whether the subdominant gravity of the NSC or a moderate\nglobal inflow is included. The predicted X-ray luminosity of $\\sim10^{36}~\\rm\nerg~s^{-1}$, dominated by the hot ($T\\sim10^7-10^8~\\rm K$) plasma within 0.2\nparsec of the SMBH, is well consistent with Chandra observations. We conclude\nthat the feeding mechanism of M31* is successfully identified, which has\nimportant implications for the working of dormant SMBHs prevalent in the local\nuniverse.\n",

      "summary": "  As thousands of new open clusters in the Galaxy have recently been reported\nwith reddening or extinction information, we map the distribution and\nproperties of the Galaxy's interstellar material in the Galactic disk as traced\nby these open clusters. By analyzing the distribution of interstellar\nextinction for 6215 open clusters located at low Galactic latitude b <= 6 deg,\ncorresponding to the thin Galactic disk, we identify a reddening plane\ncharacterized by a dust layer whose thickness varies with Galactic longitude.\nBy splitting the open clusters sample into several sub-regions of Galactic\nlongitude, we observe that the reddening plane is not perfectly aligned with\nthe formal Galactic plane, but instead varies sinusoidally around the Galactic\nmid-plane. The maximum and minimum interstellar absorption occur at\napproximately 42 deg and 222 deg, respectively, along the Galactic longitude.\nOur analysis reveals a noticeable north-south asymmetry in the distribution of\ninterstellar absorption, with a higher proportion of interstellar material\nbelow the Galactic plane. We also find that the Sun is located 15.7 +/- 7.3 pc\nabove the reddening plane. The scale height of the open clusters from the\nreddening plane is estimated to be z_h = 87.3 +/- 1.8 pc. The mean thickness of\nthe absorbing material in the reddening plane, which represents the average\nextent of the dust layer responsible for interstellar extinction, is found to\nbe about 201 +/- 20 pc. Our findings provide insights into the distribution of\ninterstellar dust, its relationship with the Galactic thin disk, and its\nimplications for the Galactic structure.\n",

      "title": "FROST-CLUSTERS -- II. Massive stars, binaries and triples boost\n  supermassive black hole seed formation in assembling star clusters",
      "summary": "  Observations and high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations indicate that\nmassive star clusters form through a complex hierarchical assembly. We use\nsimulations including post-Newtonian dynamics and stellar evolution to\ninvestigate this collisional assembly with the \\bifrost{} code coupled to the\n\\sevn{} stellar evolution module. With a full initial stellar mass function, we\nstudy the effect of initial binary and triple stars as well a high initial\nsingle star mass limit (450 $M_\\odot$) on the hierarchical assembly, structure,\nand kinematics of massive ($M_\\mathrm {cl}\\sim10^6 M_\\odot$, $N=1.8 \\times\n10^6$) star clusters. Simultaneously, intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs),\npotential seeds for supermassive black holes, can form and grow in our models\nby stellar collisions, tidal disruption events (TDEs) and black hole (BH)\nmergers. At a fixed cluster mass, stellar multiplicity or a high mass limit\nincrease the numbers (up to $\\sim$ 10) and masses (up to $10^4 M_\\odot$) of the\nformed IMBHs within the first 10 Myr of cluster evolution. The TDE rates peak\nat $\\Gamma_\\mathrm {tde}\\sim 5 \\times 10^{-5}$ yr$^{-1}$ shortly after IMBH\nformation at $\\sim 2$ Myr. In all simulations, we find gravitational wave\ndriven mergers involving stellar BHs and IMBHs. Initial multiplicity or a high\nmass limit also result in IMBH-IMBH mergers. The IMBH masses correlate with the\ninitial cluster masses, surface densities and velocity dispersions\napproximately as $M_\\bullet \\propto M_\\mathrm{cl}$, $M_\\bullet \\propto\n\\Sigma_\\mathrm{h}^\\mathrm{3/2}$ and $M_\\bullet \\propto \\sigma^\\mathrm{3}$. Our\nresults suggest IMBH masses above $M_\\bullet \\gtrsim 10^4 M_\\odot$ for the\ndense $z\\sim10$ star clusters recently observed by the James Webb Space\nTelescope.\n",

The dense gaseous\nenvironment in NSCs gives rise to dynamical phenomena that are otherwise rare\nin other gas-free environments. Here we extend the derivation introduced in\nBahcall \\& Wolf 1976 to include an additional energy dissipation term\nassociated with gas drag.

      "summary": "  Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) reveal a previously\nunseen population of compact red objects, known as ``little red dots`` (LRDs).\nWe study a new photometrically selected sample of 124 LRDs in the redshift\nrange $z$ $\\sim$ 3 - 10 selected from NIRCam coverage of the CEERS, NEP-TDF,\nJADES and JEMS surveys. For JADES, the NEP-TDF and CEERS, we compare SED models\nwith and without AGN components and analyse the impact of an AGN component on\nthe goodness of fit using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). We find\nthat whilst the $\\chi^{2}$ of the majority of models containing AGN components\nis improved compared to models without AGN components, we show that the BIC\nsuggests models without AGN are a more appropriate fit to LRD SEDs, especially\nwhen MIRI data is available. We also measure LRD clustering in the CEERS field,\nJADES field, and NEP-TDF, where we compare the spatial distribution of LRDs and\ngalaxies with Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests of equality of distribution. We find\nthat the neighbourhood of LRDs tends to be less dense compared to galaxies at\nall selections and masses and at similar redshifts. We further measure upper\nlimit estimates for the halo masses of LRDs using abundance matching. Whilst\nthe population of LRDs could be a mixture of several different inherent\npopulations, as a whole it does appear that these systems are mostly hosting\ncompact galaxies or star clusters in formation.\n",

      "title": "Stability of a cluster-disrupted mean-motion resonance (chain) in HR\n  8799 and PDS 70",
      "summary": "  HR~8799 is a planetary system with four planets potentially in a mean-motion\nresonance chain. It is unclear from the observations if they are in mean-motion\nresonance. Similarly, PDS~70 has two observed planets also potentially in\nmean-motion resonance. We simulate HR~8799 and PDS~70 under external\nperturbations to study their responds if in resonance or mean-motion resonance.\nWe integrate the equations of motion for HR~8799 and PDS~70 starting with\neither in resonance or in mean-motion resonance and study their in isolation\nand in a star cluster. In the star cluster, we take the effects of passing\nstars into account. The dynamics of the star cluster is resolved using the\nLonely Planets module in AMUSE. HR~8799 and PDS~70 in mean-motion resonance are\nstable, whereas in non-resonance they dissolve in $0.303\\pm0.042$Myr and\n$1.26\\pm0.25$Myr, respectively. In a cluster, the non-resonant HR~8799 is\nslightly more stable than in isolation, but still dissolves in\n$0.300\\pm0.043$Myr, whereas the resonant planetary system remains stable for at\nleast $0.71$Myr. In contrast, a non-resonant PDS~70 system is approximately\nequally stable in a cluster compared to isolation, and dissolves in\n$1.03\\pm0.20$Myr, whereas the resonant PDS~70 system remains stable for at\nleast $0.83$Myr. Considering the more stable solutions of mean-motion resonance\nfor HR~8799, we argue that the planetary system was born in mean-motion\nresonance and that the mean-motion resonance was preserved. If HR~8799 was not\nborn in resonance, the probability that it survived until the present day is\nnegligible. Similarly, we argue that PDS~70 was probably born in mean-motion\nresonance and that its state was preserved. We also find that it is almost\npossible for planetary systems with a broken mean-motion resonance chain to\nsurvive longer in a perturbing cluster environment compared to isolation.\n",

      "title": "CLUES III: Do User Choices Impact The Results of SED Fitting? Tests of\n  'Off-The-Shelf' Stellar Population and Dust Extinction Models in the CLUES\n  Sample",
      "summary": "  The simple stellar population models produced by stellar population and\nspectral synthesis (SPS) codes are used as spectral templates in a variety of\nastrophysical contexts. In this paper, we test the predictions of four commonly\nused stellar population synthesis codes (YGGDRASIL, BPASS, FSPS, and a modified\nform of GALAXEV which we call GALAXEVneb) by using them as spectral templates\nfor photometric SED fitting with a sample of 18 young stellar clusters. All\nclusters have existing HST COS FUV spectroscopy that provide constraints on\ntheir ages as well as broadband photometry from HST ACS and WFC3. We use model\nspectra that account for both nebular and stellar emission, and additionally\ntest four extinction curves at different values of $R_V$. We find that for\nindividual clusters, choice of extinction curve and SPS model can introduce\nsignificant scatter into the results of SED fitting. Model choice can introduce\nscatter of 34.8 Myr in age, a factor of 9.5 in mass, and 0.40mag in extinction.\nExtinction curve choice can introduce scatter of up to a factor of 32.3 Myr in\nage, a factor of 10.4 in mass, and 0.41mag in extinction. We caution that\nbecause of this scatter, one-to-one comparisons between the properties of\nindividual objects derived using different SED fitting setups may not be\nmeaningful. However, our results also suggest that SPS model and extinction\ncurve choice do not introduce major systematic differences into SED fitting\nresults when the entire cluster population is considered. The distribution of\ncluster properties for a large enough sample is relatively robust to user\nchoice of SPS code and extinction curve.\n",

      "summary": "  We present a decade-long investigation of a poorly studied cluster, Berkeley\n65 (Be 65), using deep optical data from the telescopes of ARIES, Nainital\nObservatory. We estimate its radius ($R_{cluster}$ = 1.6$^{'}$, aspect ratio of\n$\\sim$1.1), distance (2.0 $\\pm$ 0.1 kpc) and age ($\\sim$160 Myrs). A clear\nturn-off point at $\\sim$1.7 M$_\\odot$ in the mass function suggests the escape\nof low-mass stars, and the lower photometric mass compared to the dynamical\nmass indicates ongoing disruption due to external forces. Our long-baseline\noptical photometric data also identifies 64 periodic and 16 non-periodic stars\nin this region. We have presented the light curves and the classification of\nthose variables. The periodic stars have periods ranging from $\\sim$0.05 days\nto $\\sim$3.00 days and amplitude ranges from $\\sim$8 mmag to $\\sim$700 mmag.\nThe nonperiodic stars show variation from $\\sim$30 mmag to $\\sim$500 mmag. The\nperiodic stars include main-sequence pulsating variables such as Slow Pulsating\nB-type, $\\delta$ Scuti, RR Lyrae, and $\\gamma$ Doradus. We report a detached\nbinary system and rotating variables similar to BY Draconis-type stars\nexhibiting variable brightness caused by starspots, chromospheric activity, and\nmagnetic field-related phenomena.\n",

      "summary": "  Gas giant planets have been detected on eccentric orbits several hundreds of\nastronomical units in size around other stars. It has been proposed that even\nthe Sun hosts a wide-orbit planet of 5-10 Earth masses, often called Planet\nNine, which influences the dynamics of distant Trans-Neptunian objects.\nHowever, the formation mechanism of such planets remains uncertain. Here we use\nnumerical simulations to show that very wide-orbit planets are a natural\nbyproduct of dynamical instabilities that occur in planetary systems while\ntheir host stars are still embedded in natal stellar clusters. A planet is\nfirst brought to an eccentric orbit with an apoastron of several hundred au by\nrepeated gravitational scattering by other planets, then perturbations from\nnearby stellar flybys stabilise the orbit by decoupling the planet from the\ninteraction with the inner system. In our Solar System, the two main events\nlikely conducive to planetary scattering were the growth of Uranus and Neptune,\nand the giant planets instability. We estimate a 5-10% likelihood of creating a\nvery wide-orbit planet if either happened while the Sun was still in its birth\ncluster, rising to 40% if both were. In our simulated exoplanetary systems, the\ntrapping efficiency is 1-5\\%. Our results imply that planets on wide, eccentric\norbits occur at least $10^{-3}$ per star.\n",
