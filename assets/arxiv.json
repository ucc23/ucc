      "title": "The evolution of a supermassive binary black hole in an non-spherical\n  nuclear star cluster",
      "summary": "  (abridged) We consider a secular orbital evolution of a supermassive binary\nblack hole (SBBH) with unequal masses $M_p$ and $M_s < M_p$ in a central part\nof a non-spherical nuclear star cluster (NSC). When the mass of NSC inside the\norbit is smaller than $M_{s}$ dynamical friction becomes inefficient. The\nsubsequent orbital evolution of SBBH is largely governed by perturbing tidal\npotential of NSC arising from its non-sphericity. When the perturbing potential\nis mainly determined by quadrupole harmonics with azimuthal number $|m|=2$ the\nsecular dynamics of the SBBH does not conserve any components of the angular\nmomentum and can lead to the formation of highly eccentric orbits. Such orbits\ncan experience an efficient circularization due to emission of gravitational\nwaves (GW). In this Paper we consider this situation in some detail. We study\nanalytically and numerically the orbital evolution taking into account the\nimportant effect of Einstein apsidal precession and estimate the largest\npossible value of $e$, which can be obtained. We then estimate a possibility of\nfast orbital circularization through emission of gravitation waves on a highly\neccentric orbit, with circularization timescale of the order of the orbital\nperiod. We find that our mechanism could result in such events on a time scale\nof the order of or smaller than a few Gyr. It is stressed that for particular\nvalues of the model parameters such events may sometimes be distinguished from\nthe ones expected in more standard scenarios, since in our case the\neccentricity may remain substantial all the way down to the final merger. It is\nalso noted that our results can be applied to other astrophysical settings,\ne.g. to study the orbital evolution of a binary star or a proto planetary\nsystem inside a massive deformed gas cloud.\n",

      "title": "Stephenson 2 DFK 52: Discovery of an exotic red supergiant in the\n  massive stellar cluster RSGC2",
      "summary": "  Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations at 1.3mm\nhave recently revealed surprising complexity in the circumstellar environment\nof DFK 52, a red supergiant (RSG) located in the Stephenson 2 massive open\ncluster. We provide an initial characterisation of the star's mass-loss\nproperties by studying its circumstellar emission in continuum, $^{12}$CO,\n$^{13}$CO, and SiO rotational lines. We find that DFK 52 is surrounded by an\nextremely large outflow (up to 50,000 au in radius) that shows complex\nmorphologies in both its molecular and dust emission. The size of the\ncircumstellar medium is unprecedented, even when compared with other known\nextreme RSGs, and its lower luminosity indicates that its mass ejection\nmechanism may be unique among this population. The molecular emission can be\npartially reproduced by a two-component model consisting of a fast (27 km/s)\ndetached equatorial component with $M{\\sim}0.05$ $M_{\\odot}$ and a slow (10\nkm/s) spherical envelope with $\\dot{M}\\sim3\\times10^{-6}$ $M_{\\odot}$\nyr$^{-1}$. This suggests that DFK 52 underwent a dramatic mass-loss event\n$\\sim$4000 years ago, but has since transitioned into having a slower more\nsymmetric mass loss. We conservatively estimate a total mass of $0.1-1$\n$M_{\\odot}$ in the complex extended regions of the outflow. The uncertain\nnature of the dramatic mass loss warrants extensive follow-up of this likely\nsupernova progenitor.\n",

      "title": "Angular-momentum pairs in spherical systems: applications to the\n  Galactic centre",
      "summary": "  Consider a system of point masses in a spherical potential. In such systems\nobjects execute planar orbits covering two-dimensional rings or annuli,\nrepresented by the angular-momentum vectors, which slowly reorient due to the\npersistent weak gravitational interaction between different rings. This\nprocess, called vector resonant relaxation, is much faster than other processes\nwhich change the size/shape of the rings. The interaction is stron9gest between\nobjects with closely aligned angular-momentum vectors. In this paper, we show\nthat nearly parallel angular-momentum vectors may form stable bound pairs in\nangular-momentum space. We examine the stability of such pairs against an\nexternal massive perturber, and determine the critical separation analogous to\nthe Hill radius or tidal radius in the three-body problem, where the\nangular-momentum pairs are marginally disrupted, as a function of the\nperturber's mass, the orbital inclination, and the radial distance.\nAngular-momentum pairs or multiples closer than the critical inclination will\nremain bound and evolve together in angular-momentum-direction space under any\nexternal influence, such as anisotropic density fluctuations, or massive\nperturbers. This study has applications in various astrophysical contexts,\nincluding galactic nuclei, in particular the Milky Way's Galactic centre,\nglobular clusters, or planetary systems. In nuclear star clusters with a\ncentral super-massive black hole, we apply this criterion to the disc of young,\nmassive stars, and show that clusters in angular-momentum space may be used to\nconstrain the presence of intermediate-mass black holes or the mass of the\nnearby gaseous torus.\n",

      "title": "Dynamical traction and black hole orbital migration",
      "summary": "  We investigate the circumstances which allow a black hole to remain put at\nthe galactic centre when the stellar core is anisotropic. We use N-body\ncalculations to study the response of stellar orbit families embedded in a\nlarger, isotropic isochrone (H\\'enon) background potential. When the BH orbits\nin an odd f[E,Lz] velocity distribution function, they transfer angular\nmomentum to it. We call this dynamical traction: it takes place whenever the\nkinetic energy drawn from f[E,Lz] has an excess of streaming motion over its\n(isotropic) v-dispersion. For a dynamically cold disc, the outcome depends on\nboth the orbit of the BH and that of a Jeans-unstable stellar sub-structures.\nWhen the stellar clumps have much binding energy, a BH may scatter off of them\nafter they formed. In the process the BH may be dislodged from the centre and\nmigrate outward due to dynamical traction. When the stellar clumps are less\nbound, they may still migrate to the centre where they either dissolve or merge\nwith the BH. The final configuration is similar to a nuclear star cluster which\nmay yet be moving at ~10 km/s wrt the barycentre.\n  The angular momentum transferred to a BH by dynamical traction delays the\nmigration to the galactic centre by several hundred million years. The\nefficiency of angular momentum transfer is a strong function of the fragmented\n(cold) state of the stellar space density. In a dynamically cold environment, a\nBH is removed from the central region through a two-stage orbital migration\ninstability. A criterion against this instability is proposed in the form of a\nthreshold in isotropic velocity dispersion compared to streaming motion. For a\nBH to settle at the heart of a galaxy on time-scales of ~ 300 Myr or less\nrequires that a large fraction of Lz be dissipated, or, alternatively, that the\nBH grows in situ in an isotropic environment devoid of sub-structures.\n",

      "summary": "  We present Hubble Space Telescope far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectra of a\nblue-lurker$-$white-dwarf (BL-WD) binary system in the 4 Gyr open cluster M67.\nWe fit the FUV spectrum of the WD, determining it is a C/O WD with a mass of\n$0.72^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$ M$_\\odot$ and a cooling age of $\\sim400$ Myr. This\nrequires a WD progenitor of $\\sim3$ M$_\\odot$, significantly larger than the\ncurrent cluster turnoff mass of 1.3 M$_\\odot$. We suggest the WD progenitor\nstar formed several hundred Myr ago via the merger of two stars near the\nturnoff of the cluster. In this scenario, the original progenitor system was a\nhierarchical triple consisting of a close, near-equal-mass inner binary, with a\ntertiary companion with an orbit of a few thousand days. The WD is descended\nfrom the merged inner binary, and the original tertiary is now the observed BL.\nThe likely formation scenario involves a common envelope while the WD\nprogenitor is on the AGB, and thus the observed orbital period of 359 days\nrequires an efficient common envelope ejection. The rapid rotation of the BL\nindicates it accreted some material during its evolution, perhaps via a wind\nprior to the common envelope. This system will likely undergo a second common\nenvelope in the future, and thus could result in a short-period double WD\nbinary or merger of a 0.72 M$_\\odot$ C/O WD and a 0.38 $M_\\odot$ Helium WD,\nmaking this a potential progenitor of an interesting transient such as a\nsub-Chandrasekhar Type Ia supernova.\n",
