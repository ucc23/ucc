      "title": "Is Earendel a Star Cluster?: Metal Poor Globular Cluster Progenitors at\n  $z\\sim6$",
      "summary": "  The strongly-lensed $z\\sim 6$ Sunrise galaxy offers an incredible opportunity\nto investigate star formation in the early universe on parsec or smaller\nscales. The highly magnified object Earendel within the Sunrise was previously\nidentified as a candidate star or binary due to size constraints placed by the\nlensing magnification, however recent works have suggested this constraint may\nbe relaxed to even the size of star clusters. Here, we explore the hypothesis\nthat Earendel may actually be a star cluster, and simultaneously evaluate other\nstar clusters within the host galaxy. Leveraging deep, archival James Webb\nSpace Telescope NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopy, we determine a spectroscopic\nredshift for the Sunrise galaxy $z=5.926 \\pm 0.013$, and we fit simple stellar\npopulation (SSP) models from three premier libraries to evaluate the physical\nparameters of Earendel and another distinct star cluster in the Sunrise dubbed\n`$1b$'. We find the rest-UV through optical continuum of Earendel to be\nwell-described by an SSP, nearly equivalently to $1b$ which is confidently a\nstar cluster. We infer they have intermediate ages $t_{\\rm age}\\sim\n30$--$150\\,$Myr, are metal poor ($Z_\\star\\lesssim10\\%\\,Z_\\odot$), and are\nconsistent with the formation age-metallicity trend seen in local globular\nclusters. Such intermediate age clusters are seldom probed spectroscopically in\nthe high redshift universe, and we explore the extent to which these clusters\ncan be characterized via the spectroscopic continuum.\n",

      "title": "A Comprehensive Study of Czernik 41 and NGC 1342 Using CCD UBV and Gaia\n  DR3 Data",
      "summary": "  In this study, the structural, astrophysical, kinematic, and Galactic orbital\nparameters of the open clusters Czernik 41 and NGC 1342, as well as their\ndynamical evolution, are investigated using CCD UBV photometry and Gaia data.\nBy applying the UPMASK algorithm to Gaia astrometric data for the estimation of\ncluster membership probabilities, we have determined that 382 stars in Czernik\n41 and 111 stars in NGC 1342 exhibit the highest statistical likelihood of\nbeing cluster members. Fundamental parameters (including reddening,\nmetallicity, distance, and age) were derived using both classical methods,\nwhere parameters are determined separately, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\nmethods, where parameters are estimated simultaneously. The results obtained\nfrom both approaches are in agreement, confirming the reliability of the\nderived parameters and demonstrating their robustness against potential\ndegeneracies. The distances to Czernik 41 and NGC 1342 were determined as\n2485$\\pm$151 pc and 645$\\pm$42 pc, respectively, while their ages were\nestimated to be 69$\\pm$10 Myr and 1000$\\pm$50 Myr. The metallicity values\n([Fe/H]) were found to be 0.07$\\pm$0.09 dex for Czernik 41 and -0.14$\\pm$0.07\ndex for NGC 1342. The stellar mass functions for both clusters were derived,\nyielding slopes of $\\Gamma$=1.67$\\pm$0.23 for Czernik 41 and $\\Gamma$\n=1.56$\\pm$0.41 for NGC 1342. Kinematic orbit analysis indicates that Czernik 41\noriginated within the Solar circle, whereas NGC 1342 formed outside it.\n",

      "title": "Centrally concentrated star formation in young clusters",
      "summary": "  The study of star cluster evolution necessitates modeling how their density\nprofiles develop from their natal gas distribution. Observational evidence\nindicates that many star clusters follow a Plummer density profile. However,\nmost studies have focused on the phase after gas ejection, neglecting the\ninfluence of gas on early dynamical evolution. We investigate the development\nof star clusters forming within gas clouds, particularly those with a centrally\nconcentrated gas profile. Simulations were conducted using the \\texttt{Torch}\nframework, integrating the \\texttt{FLASH} magnetohydrodynamics code into\n\\texttt{AMUSE}. This permits detailed modeling of star formation, stellar\nevolution, stellar dynamics, radiative transfer, and gas magnetohydrodynamics.\nWe study the collapse of centrally concentrated, turbulent spheres with a total\nmass of $2.5\\times 10^3\\, M_\\odot$, investigating the effects of varying\nnumerical resolution and star formation scenarios. The free-fall time is\nshorter at the center than at the edges of the cloud, with a minimum value of\n$0.55\\,\\mathrm{Myr}$. The key conclusions from this study are: (1) subclusters\ninitially form even in dense gas clouds; (2) the final stellar density profile\nis consistent with a Plummer profile, but more centrally concentrated than\nanalytically predicted; (3) gas collapses globally toward the center on the\ncentral free-fall time scale, contradicting the assumption in analytical models\nof local fragmentation and star formation; (4) hence, gas is predominantly\nejected from the innermost regions; and (5) the final value of the SFE depends\non the mass and formation time of the most massive star as well as the overall\nstar formation timescale.\n",

      "summary": "  Recent measurements of cosmogenic $^{10}$Be in deep-ocean ferromanganese\ncrusts from the Central and Northern Pacific have revealed an anomalous\nconcentration between 11.5 and 9.0 Myr ago, peaking at 10.1 Myr. One possible\nexplanation is a nearby supernova (SN) event. Motivated by this and by the\nproximity of the Solar System to the Orion star-forming region during that\nperiod, we estimate the probability that at least one SN occurred between the\nonset and peak of the anomaly. Using an open cluster catalog based on Gaia DR3,\nwe trace back the orbits of 2725 clusters and the Sun over the past 20 Myr and\ncompute the expected number of SN events. We find 19 clusters with a\nprobability greater than 1% each of producing at least one SN within 100 pc of\nthe Sun in the time interval 11.5-10.1 Myr ago. The total cumulative\nprobability exceeds zero at 35 pc from the Sun and increases rapidly with\ndistance, reaching 68% near 100 pc. Two young clusters dominate the SN\nprobability: ASCC 20 contributes most within 70 pc, while OCSN 61 becomes more\nsignificant beyond that distance. Our results support the plausibility of a SN\norigin for the $^{10}$Be anomaly and highlight the importance of additional\n$^{10}$Be records from independent terrestrial archives to determine whether\nthe anomaly is of astrophysical or terrestrial origin.\n",

      "summary": "  We present new JWST/NIRCam observations of the starburst irregular galaxy NGC\n4449, obtained in Cycle 1 as part of the Feedback in Emerging extrAgalactic\nStar clusTers (FEAST) program, which we use to investigate its resolved stellar\npopulations and their spatial distributions. NGC4449 NIR color-magnitude\ndiagrams reveal a broad range of stellar populations, spanning different\nevolutionary phases, from young main sequence stars, to old red giant branch\nstars and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. The analysis of their spatial\ndistributions shows that younger (< 10 Myr) populations form an S-shaped\ndistribution aligned with the galaxy's north-south axis, while stars aged 10 -\n60 Myr show shifting concentrations from the north to the south, consistent\nwith the possibility that external interactions or tidal effects may have\ntriggered star formation in spatially distinct bursts. Clusters of comparable\nages generally follow these distributions, suggesting that cluster and field\nstars form at the same pace in each galaxy region. Thanks to the unprecedented\nhigh-spatial resolution and sensitivity of the JWST data we recover a clear gap\nbetween Oxygen-rich and the carbon star branch of the AGB population and the\npresence of a massive AGB star \"finger\". The analysis of these stars can\nprovide constraints on AGB evolution models and dust production in this galaxy.\nThese results confirms NGC 4449 status as a compelling example of a local dwarf\nstarburst galaxy undergoing complex and possibly external driven star formation\nand underscore the power of JWST in probing the full lifecycle of stars in\nnearby starburst systems.\n",

      "summary": "  A detailed analysis of the structural, astrophysical, kinematic, and\ndynamical properties of the open clusters Roslund 3 and Ruprecht1 74 is carried\nout using CCD UBV photometry in conjunction with astrometric and photometric\ndata from Gaia DR3. Membership probabilities were computed via the UPMASK\nalgorithm applied to Gaia proper motions and trigonometric parallaxes, leading\nto the identification of 198 likely members for Roslund 3 and 397 for Ruprecht\n174. Astrophysical parameters were derived using both the classical approach,\nwhere parameters are independently determined, and a MCMC technique, which\nestimates them simultaneously. The agreement between the results from both\nmethods confirms their reliability and highlights the robustness of the\nclassical method. The reddening values were determined as $E(B-V)=0.410\\pm\n0.046$ mag for Roslund 3 and $E(B-V)=0.615\\pm 0.042$ mag for Ruprecht 174. The\nestimated distances are $d=1687 \\pm 121$ pc for Roslund 3 and $d=2385 \\pm 163$\npc for Ruprecht 174. Both clusters exhibit metallicities close to the solar\nvalue, with [Fe/H] = $0.030 \\pm 0.065$ dex for Roslund 3 and [Fe/H] = $0.041\n\\pm 0.064$ dex for Ruprecht 174. The corresponding ages were found to be\n$\\tau=60\\pm 6$ and $\\tau=520\\pm 50$ Myr, respectively. The present day mass\nfunction slopes were found to be $1.18 \\pm 0.13$ for Roslund 3 and $1.53 \\pm\n0.30$ for Ruprecht 174, consistent with the canonical Salpeter value within\nuncertainties. Galactic orbital analyses indicate that both clusters are\nthin-disk members confined within the Solar circle. Additionally, relaxation\ntimes and spatial distributions of stars suggest that both clusters have\nreached dynamical relaxation and exhibit clear signs of mass segregation.\n",

      "title": "Massive Interacting Binaries Enhance Feedback in Star-Forming Regions",
      "summary": "  We present a new framework to incorporate feedback from massive interacting\nbinaries in simulations of star cluster formation. Our new feedback model adds\nbinary stellar evolution to the cluster formation code Torch, and couples it in\nAMUSE to the pre-existing modules for collisional stellar dynamics,\nmagnetohydrodynamics, and mechanical and radiative feedback. Our model accounts\nfor the effects of mass transfer on the stars' mass loss rates, their radiation\nspectra, and the timing of core-collapse supernovae. It also injects mass lost\nthrough non-conservative mass transfer and common envelope ejection into the\ninterstellar medium. We demonstrate the use of our feedback model through\nsimulations of isolated binaries in a gaseous medium, and of embedded clusters\nof massive binaries. Feedback from interacting binaries efficiently couples\nwith the surrounding interstellar medium. It increases the size of HII regions,\nincreases the kinetic and thermal energy of the gas, and increases the pressure\nwithin HII regions compared to models that use single star stellar evolution.\nThose differences arise from the ionizing radiation, which increases by three\norders of magnitude, resulting in HII regions that expand due to thermal\npressure rather than radiation pressure. The effects of stellar dynamics and\nthe gravitational potential of the background gas cause the evolution of\nindividual binaries to deviate from the predictions made by secular evolution,\nimpacting the subsequent feedback from the binary. We conclude that massive\ninteracting binaries are an important source of feedback in cluster-forming\nregions, and must be considered when studying the emerging timescales of young\nstar clusters.\n",

      "title": "Spatially Resolving the Fundamental Elements of Reionization in Galaxies",
      "summary": "  Cosmic reionization marks a critical epoch when the first galaxies ionized\nthe intergalactic medium through the escape of Lyman continuum (LyC) radiation.\nYoung, massive star clusters are believed to be the primary LyC sources, yet\nthe physical mechanisms enabling LyC escape remain poorly understood. Most\nexisting studies rely on spatially integrated observations, which lack the\nresolution to resolve internal galaxy structure and pinpoint where and how LyC\nphotons escape. To address this, we propose a science case for the Habitable\nWorlds Observatory (HWO) that enables spatially resolved spectroscopy of\nLyC-emitting star clusters and their environments in low-redshift galaxies.\nThis requires a UV integral field unit (IFU) with coverage down to ~ 900\nAngstrom and a spatial resolution of 10-100 pc-capabilities essential for\ndirectly detecting LyC escape and mapping the surrounding interstellar medium.\nWith such instrumentation, we will map cluster-scale LyC escape fractions,\ncharacterize the physical conditions of the surrounding interstellar medium,\nand directly observe feedback-driven outflows that facilitate LyC leakage.\nThese observations will enable novel calibrations of indirect LyC indicators at\nunprecedented spatial resolution and establish direct connections between local\nLyC processes and those in high-redshift, clumpy star-forming galaxies. In the\nlong run, this program will build the physical framework needed to understand\nhow galaxies reionized the early universe and shaped its subsequent evolution.\n",
