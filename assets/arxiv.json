      "title": "Spectral Evolution of Rotating Population III Stars",
      "summary": "  Population III (Pop III) stars, the first generation of stars formed from\nprimordial gas, played a fundamental role in shaping the early universe through\ntheir influence on cosmic reionization, early chemical enrichment, and the\nformation of the first galaxies. However, to date they have eluded direct\ndetection due to their short lifetimes and high redshifts. The launch of the\nJames Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revolutionized observational\ncapabilities, providing the opportunity to detect Pop~III stars via caustic\nlensing, where strong gravitational lensing magnifies individual stars to\nobservable levels. This prospect makes it compelling to develop accurate models\nfor their spectral characteristics to distinguish them from other stellar\npopulations. Previous studies have focused on computing the spectral properties\nof non-rotating, zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) Pop III stars. In this work, we\nexpand upon these efforts by incorporating the effects of stellar rotation and\npost-ZAMS evolution into spectral calculations. We use the JWST bands and\nmagnitude limits to identify the optimal observing conditions, both for\nisolated stars, as well as for small star clusters. We find that, while\nrotation does not appreciably change the observability at ZAMS, the subsequent\nevolution can significantly brighten the stars, making the most massive ones\npotentially visible with only moderate lensing.\n",

      "summary": "  We apply population synthesis techniques to analyze TYPHOON long slit spectra\nof the starburst barred spiral galaxy M83. The analysis covers a central square\nof 5 arcmin side length. We determine the spatial distribution of dust through\nthe analysis of reddening and extinction, together with star formation rates,\nages, and metallicities of young and old stellar populations. For the first\ntime, a spatial one-to-one comparison of metallicities derived from\nfull-spectral fitting techniques with those obtained from individual young\nstellar probes has been carried out. The comparison with blue supergiant stars,\nyoung massive star clusters, and super star clusters shows a high degree of\nconcordance when wavelength coverage in the $B$-band is available. The\nmetallicity of the young population is supersolar and does not show a radial\nmetallicity gradient along the investigated part of the disk, in agreement with\nour chemical evolution model. However, a notable decrease in metallicity is\nobserved in a tightly confined region at the galaxy center, coinciding with\ncircumnuclear orbits. We attribute this to matter infall either from the\ncircumgalactic medium or a dwarf galaxy interloper or, alternatively, to\nAGN-interrupted chemical evolution. We confirm the presence of a dust cavity\nwith a diameter of 260~pc close to the galaxy center. Dust absorption and\nmolecular CO emission are spatially well correlated. We find an anticorrelation\nbetween R$_V$, the ratio of dust attenuation to reddening, and the emission\nstrength of molecular species present in photo-dissociation regions. We confirm\nour results by using alternative fitting algorithms and stellar libraries.\n",

      "summary": "  Young star clusters can inherit bulk rotation from the molecular clouds from\nwhich they have formed. This rotation can affect the long-term evolution of a\nstar cluster and its constituent stellar populations. In this study, we aim to\ncharacterize the effects of different degrees of initial rotation on star\nclusters with primordial binaries. The simulations are performed using\nNBODY6++GPU. We find that initial rotation strongly affects the early evolution\nof star clusters. Rapidly rotating clusters show angular momentum transport\nfrom the inner parts to the outskirts, resulting in a core collapse. Angular\nmomentum transport is accompanied by a highly elongated bar-like structure\nmorphology. The effects of bulk rotation are reduced on the timescale of\ntwo-body relaxation. Rotating and non-rotating clusters experience changes in\nthe direction of angular momentum near the dissolution and early evolution due\nto the tidal field, respectively. We present synthetic observations of\nsimulated clusters for comparison with future observations in filters of Gaia,\nCSST, and HST. This work shows the effects of bulk rotation on systems with\nprimordial binaries and could be used for the identification of rotation\nsignatures in observed open clusters.\n",

      "summary": "  The origin of supermassive black holes is an open question that has been\nexplored considering gas- and collision-based formation channels to explain the\nhigh number of quasars observed in the early Universe. According to numerical\nsimulations, supermassive stars can be formed in atomic cooling halos when\nprotostars reach accretion rates greater than $\\sim\n10^{-2}~\\mathrm{M_{\\odot}~yr^{-1}}$ and fragmentation is inhibited on parsec\nscales. It remains uncertain, however, whether fragmentation on smaller scales\nleads to the formation of a star cluster instead of a supermassive star in the\npresence of possible cooling mechanisms. We explored the formation of a central\nmassive object through collisions and the accretion of Population III stars in\na primordial gas cloud in a gravitationally unstable system by varying the gas\ntemperature and the degree of gravitational instability. We performed\nmultiphysics simulations in the AMUSE framework with a hydrodynamical gas\ntreatment through Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics and $N$-body dynamics for the\nprotostars represented through sink particles. Our results show that central\nmassive objects with masses $\\sim 10^4~\\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$ can be formed by\naccretion and collisions at different temperatures and that the most massive\nobject can reach efficiencies of $\\sim 0.61$ for atomic cooling conditions and\n$\\sim 0.95$ for more unstable conditions. We observe a quasi-disk formation for\nwarmer temperatures and a higher contribution through collisions to the mass of\na central massive object. Our results show that the embedded cluster is in a\nsupercompetitive accretion regime in which it obtains mass by accretion that is\nregulated by self-gravity. Our results suggest that in more unstable conditions\nwith lower gas temperatures, a more massive supermassive black hole seed can\nform.\n",

This work aims to determine precise and homogeneous\nmetallicities for a number of old ($\\geq$ 500 Myr) clusters from all-sky\ncatalogues of stellar parameters leveraging Gaia spectrophotometry. Our purpose\nwas to revisit the metallicity distribution of the oldest open clusters as a\nfunction of their Galactic position and age with improved statistics. Our\nsample includes ~600 old open clusters with a typical precision of 0.05 dex in\nmetallicity. We identified metal-poor or metal-rich clusters never studied\nbefore, as well as moving groups as the remnants of dissolving clusters.\nGalactic maps show a smooth decrease of metallicity from inside to outside the\ndisc. Metal-rich and metal-poor clusters exist at all ages but dominate\nrespectively in the inner and the outer disc, with different scale heights.The\nradial metallicity gradient was found to have a knee shape with a steep value\nof -0.084$\\pm$0.004 dex/kpc in the inner side and -0.018$\\pm$0.004 dex/kpc\noutside the knee. The inner radial gradient flattens with age. Vertically, the\nmetallicity gradient is -0.415$\\pm$0.030 dex/kpc. The large scatter in the\ndistribution of metallicity versus age is well explained by the superposition\nof OC populations standing at different Galactocentric distances, each with its\nown mean metallicity and small dispersion, less than 0.08 dex in radius bins of\n1 kpc.Our results are consistent with a negative radial metallicity gradient of\ninterstellar matter that was present in the disc when the clusters formed. The\nlow metallicity dispersion in each radius bin reflects weak radial mixing.\n",

      "title": "Stellar-mass black holes in young massive and open stellar clusters --\n  VI. Role of external galactic field",
      "summary": "  Young massive clusters (YMC) and open clusters (OC) are widely considered as\npotential environments for assembling merging binary stellar-remnant black\nholes (BBH) via dynamical interactions. However, such moderate mass systems are\nsusceptible to being disrupted by the external tidal field of their host\ngalaxies, potentially limiting their effectiveness as GW sources. In this\nstudy, I investigate the formation of BBH mergers in tidally dissolving star\nclusters. This is achieved with a newly computed grid consisting of 95\nevolutionary model star clusters, where the clusters are subjected to a varying\nextent of tidal stripping. The cluster evolutions are computed with the direct\nN-body integrator NBODY7 that includes, among others, treatments for\npost-Newtonian (PN) effects in compact-binary members, mass loss due to stellar\nevolution, formation of stellar remnants, and tidal stripping. It is found that\neven strong tidal stripping does not quench the formation of a black hole (BH)\ncore inside a cluster or the formation of dynamical BBH mergers in the system.\nThe overall properties of BBH mergers, e.g., the form of the distribution of\nmerger delay time, primary mass, and mass ratio, and the redshift evolution of\nmerger rate are not significantly altered by the extent of tidal stripping of\nthe parent cluster population. Furthermore, even strongly tidally stripped\nclusters are capable of dynamically forming Gaia-BH-like detached\nBH--main-sequence-star binaries that escape into the galactic field.\nLimitations of the present study and potential future improvements are\ndiscussed.\n",

      "title": "Oort Cloud Formation and Evolution in Star Clusters",
      "summary": "  It is unknown if an Oort cloud reaches its maximum mass within its star's\nbirth cluster or millions of years later. Complicating the Oort cloud evolution\nprocess is the fact that comets can be stripped from orbit due to perturbations\nfrom passing stars. We explore how a star's cluster escape time (t$_{ \\rm\nesc}$) and the time its Oort cloud reaches maximum mass (t$_{ \\rm max}$) affect\nthe Oort cloud's ability to survive via $N$-body simulations. In a 14\nM$_\\odot$/pc$^3$ cluster, we identify 50 stars of 1 M$_\\odot$ with a range of\nt$_{ \\rm esc}$ to host Oort clouds, each with 1000 comets at t$_{ \\rm max}$.\nFor each host, we consider Oort clouds that reach maximum mass 0, 50, and 250\nMyr after the cluster's formation. Each Oort cloud's evolution is simulated in\nthe cluster from t$_{ \\rm max}$ to t$_{ \\rm esc}$. Only a fraction of comets\ntend to remain in orbit, with this amount depending on t$_{ \\rm max}$ and t$_{\n\\rm esc}$. We observe that 12%, 22%, and 32% of Oort clouds with a t$_{ \\rm\nmax}$ of 0, 50 and 250 Myr retain >50% of their comets at t$_{ \\rm esc}$,\nrespectively. We find that the fraction of comets stripped has the\nrelationship, $\\rm f=m\\log_{10}(\\frac{t_{ \\rm esc}-t_{ \\rm max}}{Myr})$ where m\n= 0.32$\\pm$0.04, indicating that the longer the Oort cloud remains in the\ncluster, the more comets are stripped, with this fraction increasing\nlogarithmically at approximately the same rate for each t$_{ \\rm max}$.\n",

      "summary": "  We study the detectability of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with masses of\n$M_{\\bullet}\\gtrsim 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ displaced by gravitational wave\nrecoil kicks $(v_{\\rm kick}=0\\mathrm{-}2000\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s}^{-1})$ in\nsimulations of merging massive $(M_{\\star}>10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot)$\nearly-type galaxies. The used KETJU code combines the GADGET-4 fast multiple\ngravity solver with accurate regularised integration and post-Newtonian\ncorrections (up to PN3.5) around SMBHs. The ejected SMBHs carry clusters of\nbound stellar material (black hole recoil clusters, BRCs) with masses in the\nrange of $10^6 \\lesssim M_{\\text{BRC}} \\lesssim 10^7\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ and\nsizes of several $10\\,\\mathrm{pc}$. For recoil velocities up to $60\\%$ of the\ngalaxy escape velocity, the BRCs are detectable in mock photometric images at a\nEuclid-like resolution up to redshift $z \\sim 1.0$. By Monte Carlo sampling the\nobservability for different recoil directions and magnitudes, we predict that\nin $\\sim20\\%$ of instances the BRCs are photometrically detectable, most likely\nfor kicks with SMBH apocentres less than the galaxy effective radius. BRCs\noccupy distinct regions in the stellar mass/velocity dispersion vs. size\nrelations of known star clusters and galaxies. An enhanced velocity dispersion\nin excess of $\\sigma \\sim 600\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s}^{-1}$ coinciding with the SMBH\nposition provides the best evidence for an SMBH-hosting stellar system,\neffectively distinguishing BRCs from other faint stellar systems. BRCs are\npromising candidates to observe the aftermath of the yet-undetected mergers of\nthe most massive SMBHs and we estimate that up to 8000 BRCs might be observable\nbelow $z\\lesssim 0.6$ with large-scale photometric surveys such as Euclid and\nupcoming high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy with the Extremely Large\nTelescope.\n",
