      "title": "The Open Cluster Chemical Abundances and Mapping Survey: VIII. Galactic\n  Chemical Gradient and Azimuthal Analysis from SDSS/MWM DR19",
      "summary": "  The Open Cluster Chemical Abundances and Mapping (OCCAM) survey seeks to\ncurate a large, comprehensive, uniform dataset of open clusters and member\nstars to constrain key Galactic parameters. This eighth entry from the OCCAM\nsurvey, based on the newly released SDSS-V/MWM Data Release 19 (DR19), has\nestablished a sample of 164 high quality open clusters that are used to\nconstrain the radial and azimuthal gradients of the Milky Way. The DR19 cluster\nsample [Fe/H] abundances are roughly consistent with measurements from other\nlarge-scale spectroscopic surveys. However, the gradients we calculate deviate\nconsiderably for some elements. We find an overall linear Galactic radial\n[Fe/H] gradient of $-0.075 \\pm 0.006$ dex kpc$^{-1}$ using the cluster's\ncurrent Galactocentric Radius ($R_{GC}$) and a gradient of $-0.068 \\pm 0.005$\ndex kpc$^-1$ with respect to the cluster's guiding center radius. We do not\nfind strong evidence for significant evolution of the differential element\ngradients ([X/Fe]) investigated here (O, Mg, Si, S, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni,\nNa, Al, K, Ce, Nd). For the first time using the OCCAM sample we have\nsufficient numbers of clusters to investigate Galactic azimuthal variations. In\nthis work, we do find evidence of azimuthal variations in the measured radial\nabundance gradient in the Galactic disk using our open cluster sample.\n",

      "title": "Mass Distribution of Binary Black Hole Mergers from Young and Old Dense\n  Star Clusters",
      "summary": "  Dense star clusters are thought to contribute significantly to the merger\nrates of stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs) detected by the\nLIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. We combine $N$-body dynamic models of realistic\ndense star clusters with cluster formation histories to estimate the merger\nrate distribution as a function of primary mass for merging BBHs formed in\nthese environments. It has been argued that dense star clusters -- most notably\nold globular clusters -- predominantly produce BBH mergers with primary masses\n$M_p\\approx30\\,M_{\\odot}$. We show that dense star clusters forming at lower\nredshifts -- and thus having higher metallicities -- naturally produce\nlower-mass BBH mergers. We find that cluster BBH mergers span a wide range of\nprimary mass, from about $6\\,M_{\\odot}$ to above $100\\,M_{\\odot}$, with a peak\nnear $8\\,M_{\\odot}$, reproducing the overall merger rate distribution inferred\nfrom gravitational wave detections. Our results show that most low-mass BBH\nmergers (about $95\\%$ with $M_p\\lesssim 20\\,M_{\\odot}$) originate in metal-rich\n($Z \\sim Z_{\\odot}$) dense star clusters, while more massive BBH mergers form\npredominately in metal-poor globular clusters. We also discuss the role of\nhierarchical mergers in shaping the BBH mass distribution. Gravitational wave\ndetection of dynamically-formed low-mass BBH mergers -- potentially\nidentifiable by features such as isotropic spin distributions -- may serve as\nprobes of cluster formation histories in metal-rich environments at low\nredshifts.\n",

      "title": "Dating N loud AGNs at high redshift: GS3073 as a snapshot of wCen like\n  evolution of a nuclear star cluster",
      "summary": "  In this paper we address two major questions raised by recent James Webb\nSpace Telescope observations of the young Universe, namely: 1) what are the\nseed initial masses, and how rapidly have supermassive black holes (BHs) with\nmasses of 1e6-1e8Msun grown in active galactic nuclei (AGN) hosted by very\nyoung galaxies? 2) What are the plausible explanations for the super solar\nabundances of nitrogen in a fraction of young galaxies at high redshift, both\nwith and without evidence of a massive central black hole? We focus mainly on\nthe system GS3073. This system shows an exceptionally large\nlog(N/O)=+0.42(+0.13/-0.10) in the gas close to the AGN. We show here that this\nabundance is consistent with the composition of gas ejected from massive\nasymptotic giant branch stars. Moreover, this system shows chemical properties\nmatching those expected at a specific point of the evolution of the abundances\nin the extreme populations of the former nuclear star cluster wCentauri (wCen).\nThis analogy, along with the N/O, C/O and Fe/O abundances in GS3073, lead to an\nestimate of an age range of 270-440 Myr for this object, much smaller than the\nredshift (z=5.5) age of about 1 Gyr. We also adopt the same criteria to\nestimate an age for GNz11. These two determinations constrain the BH mass\nversus age relation: accretion on the BH must proceed at intermittent\nsuperEddington rates in the first phases, and at a much lower rate after the\nfirst half gigayear of life of the Universe. The intermittency of accretion is\nalso a fundamental requirement to allow the formation of the extreme (N rich, O\ndepleted, He rich) populations today observed in wCen for a large range of\nmetallicities.\n",

      "title": "Is Earendel a Star Cluster?: Metal Poor Globular Cluster Progenitors at\n  $z\\sim6$",
      "summary": "  The strongly-lensed $z\\sim 6$ Sunrise galaxy offers an incredible opportunity\nto investigate star formation in the early universe on parsec or smaller\nscales. The highly magnified object Earendel within the Sunrise was previously\nidentified as a candidate star or binary due to size constraints placed by the\nlensing magnification, however recent works have suggested this constraint may\nbe relaxed to even the size of star clusters. Here, we explore the hypothesis\nthat Earendel may actually be a star cluster, and simultaneously evaluate other\nstar clusters within the host galaxy. Leveraging deep, archival James Webb\nSpace Telescope NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopy, we determine a spectroscopic\nredshift for the Sunrise galaxy $z=5.926 \\pm 0.013$, and we fit simple stellar\npopulation (SSP) models from three premier libraries to evaluate the physical\nparameters of Earendel and another distinct star cluster in the Sunrise dubbed\n`$1b$'. We find the rest-UV through optical continuum of Earendel to be\nwell-described by an SSP, nearly equivalently to $1b$ which is confidently a\nstar cluster. We infer they have intermediate ages $t_{\\rm age}\\sim\n30$--$150\\,$Myr, are metal poor ($Z_\\star\\lesssim10\\%\\,Z_\\odot$), and are\nconsistent with the formation age-metallicity trend seen in local globular\nclusters. Such intermediate age clusters are seldom probed spectroscopically in\nthe high redshift universe, and we explore the extent to which these clusters\ncan be characterized via the spectroscopic continuum.\n",

      "summary": "  In this study, the structural, astrophysical, kinematic, and Galactic orbital\nparameters of the open clusters Czernik 41 and NGC 1342, as well as their\ndynamical evolution, are investigated using CCD UBV photometry and Gaia data.\nBy applying the UPMASK algorithm to Gaia astrometric data for the estimation of\ncluster membership probabilities, we have determined that 382 stars in Czernik\n41 and 111 stars in NGC 1342 exhibit the highest statistical likelihood of\nbeing cluster members. Fundamental parameters (including reddening,\nmetallicity, distance, and age) were derived using both classical methods,\nwhere parameters are determined separately, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\nmethods, where parameters are estimated simultaneously. The results obtained\nfrom both approaches are in agreement, confirming the reliability of the\nderived parameters and demonstrating their robustness against potential\ndegeneracies. The distances to Czernik 41 and NGC 1342 were determined as\n2485$\\pm$151 pc and 645$\\pm$42 pc, respectively, while their ages were\nestimated to be 69$\\pm$10 Myr and 1000$\\pm$50 Myr. The metallicity values\n([Fe/H]) were found to be 0.07$\\pm$0.09 dex for Czernik 41 and -0.14$\\pm$0.07\ndex for NGC 1342. The stellar mass functions for both clusters were derived,\nyielding slopes of $\\Gamma$=1.67$\\pm$0.23 for Czernik 41 and $\\Gamma$\n=1.56$\\pm$0.41 for NGC 1342. Kinematic orbit analysis indicates that Czernik 41\noriginated within the Solar circle, whereas NGC 1342 formed outside it.\n",

      "title": "Centrally concentrated star formation in young clusters",
      "summary": "  The study of star cluster evolution necessitates modeling how their density\nprofiles develop from their natal gas distribution. Observational evidence\nindicates that many star clusters follow a Plummer density profile. However,\nmost studies have focused on the phase after gas ejection, neglecting the\ninfluence of gas on early dynamical evolution. We investigate the development\nof star clusters forming within gas clouds, particularly those with a centrally\nconcentrated gas profile. Simulations were conducted using the \\texttt{Torch}\nframework, integrating the \\texttt{FLASH} magnetohydrodynamics code into\n\\texttt{AMUSE}. This permits detailed modeling of star formation, stellar\nevolution, stellar dynamics, radiative transfer, and gas magnetohydrodynamics.\nWe study the collapse of centrally concentrated, turbulent spheres with a total\nmass of $2.5\\times 10^3\\, M_\\odot$, investigating the effects of varying\nnumerical resolution and star formation scenarios. The free-fall time is\nshorter at the center than at the edges of the cloud, with a minimum value of\n$0.55\\,\\mathrm{Myr}$. The key conclusions from this study are: (1) subclusters\ninitially form even in dense gas clouds; (2) the final stellar density profile\nis consistent with a Plummer profile, but more centrally concentrated than\nanalytically predicted; (3) gas collapses globally toward the center on the\ncentral free-fall time scale, contradicting the assumption in analytical models\nof local fragmentation and star formation; (4) hence, gas is predominantly\nejected from the innermost regions; and (5) the final value of the SFE depends\non the mass and formation time of the most massive star as well as the overall\nstar formation timescale.\n",
