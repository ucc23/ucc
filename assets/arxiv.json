      "title": "Line ratio identification of external photoevaporation",
      "summary": "  External photoevaporation of protoplanetary discs, by massive O stars in\nstellar clusters, is thought to be a significant process in the evolution of a\ndisc. It has been shown to result in significant mass loss and disc truncation,\nultimately reducing the lifetime of the discs, and possibly affecting potential\nplanet populations. It is a well-studied process in the Orion Nebula Cluster\n(ONC) where the cometary morphology of proplyds is spatially resolvable due to\nits proximity to Earth. However, we need to study external photoevaporation in\nadditional stellar clusters to better understand its prevalence and\nsignificance more globally. Unfortunately, more massive stellar clusters where\nthe majority of stars form are much farther away than the ONC. In these more\ndistant clusters the proplyds are spatially unresolvable with current\nfacilities, hence the cometary morphology is not a useful identification of\nexternal photoevaporation. Therefore, in order to identify and interpret\nexternal photoevaporation, the only observations we have are of spatially\nunresolved emission lines. To resolve this issue we have used the CLOUDY code\nto develop an approximate general model of the emission lines emanating from\nthe hot ionized wind of a proplyd. We have used the model to determine which\nline ratios are most sensitive to the distance from an OB star, and found that\nthe most sensitive line ratios vary by multiple orders of magnitude over an FUV\nfield of between 10$^3$ G$_0$ to 10$^6$ G$_0$. By identifying spatial gradients\nof line ratios in stellar clusters, we can identify regions of ongoing external\nphotoevaporation.\n",

      "title": "The completeness of the open cluster census towards the Galactic\n  anticentre",
      "summary": "  Open clusters have long been used as tracers of Galactic structure. However,\nwithout a selection function to describe the completeness of the cluster\ncensus, it is difficult to quantitatively interpret their distribution. We\ncreate a method to empirically determine the selection function of a Galactic\ncluster catalogue. We test it by investigating the completeness of the cluster\ncensus in the outer Milky Way, where old and young clusters exhibit different\nspatial distributions. We develop a method to generate realistic mock clusters\nas a function of their parameters, in addition to accounting for Gaia's\nselection function and astrometric errors. We then inject mock clusters into\nGaia DR3 data, and attempt to recover them in a blind search using HDBSCAN. We\nfind that the main parameters influencing cluster detectability are mass,\nextinction, and distance. Age also plays an important role, making older\nclusters harder to detect due to their fainter luminosity function. High proper\nmotions also improve detectability. After correcting for these selection\neffects, we find that old clusters are $2.97\\pm0.11$ times more common at a\nGalactocentric radius of 13~kpc than in the solar neighbourhood -- despite\npositive detection biases in their favour, such as hotter orbits or a higher\nscale height. The larger fraction of older clusters in the outer Galaxy cannot\nbe explained by an observational bias, and must be a physical property of the\nMilky Way: young outer-disc clusters are not forming in the outer Galaxy, or at\nleast not with sufficient masses to be identified as clusters in Gaia DR3. We\npredict that in this region, more old clusters than young ones remain to be\ndiscovered. The current presence of old, massive outer-disc clusters could be\nexplained by radial heating and migration, or alternatively by a lower cluster\ndestruction rate in the anticentre.\n",

      "title": "Shockingly Effective: Cluster Winds as Engines of Feedback in Starburst\n  Galaxy VV 114",
      "summary": "  We present high-resolution Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) and MUSE IFU\nspectroscopy of VV 114, a local infrared-luminous merger undergoing a vigorous\nstarburst and showing evidence of galactic-scale feedback. The high-resolution\ndata allow for spectral deblending of the optical emission lines and reveal a\nbroad emission line component ($\\sigma_{\\rm{broad}} \\sim$~100--300 km s$^{-1}$)\nwith line ratios and kinematics consistent with a mixture of ionization by\nstars and radiative shocks. The shock fraction (percent ionization due to\nshocks) in the high velocity gas is anticorrelated with projected surface\nnumber density of resolved star clusters, and we find radial density profiles\naround clusters are well fit by models of adiabatically expanding cluster winds\ndriven by massive stellar winds and supernovae (SNe). The total kinetic power\nestimated from the cluster wind models matches the wind+SNe mechanical energy\ndeposition rate estimated from the soft band X-ray luminosity, indicating that\nat least 70\\% of the shock luminosity in the galaxy is driven by the star\nclusters. \\emph{Hubble Space Telescope} narrow band near-infrared imaging\nreveals embedded shocks in the dust-buried infrared nucleus of VV 114E. Most of\nthe shocked gas is blueshifted with respect to the quiescent medium, and there\nis a close spatial correspondence between the shock map and the \\emph{Chandra}\nsoft band X-ray image, implying the presence of a galactic superwind. The\nenergy budget of the superwind is in close agreement with the total kinetic\npower of the cluster winds, confirming the superwind is driven by the\nstarburst.\n",
