      "title": "Long-term investigation of an open cluster Berkeley 65",
      "summary": "  We present a decade-long investigation of a poorly studied cluster, Berkeley\n65 (Be 65), using deep optical data from the telescopes of ARIES, Nainital\nObservatory. We estimate its radius ($R_{cluster}$ = 1.6$^{'}$, aspect ratio of\n$\\sim$1.1), distance (2.0 $\\pm$ 0.1 kpc) and age ($\\sim$160 Myrs). A clear\nturn-off point at $\\sim$1.7 M$_\\odot$ in the mass function suggests the escape\nof low-mass stars, and the lower photometric mass compared to the dynamical\nmass indicates ongoing disruption due to external forces. Our long-baseline\noptical photometric data also identifies 64 periodic and 16 non-periodic stars\nin this region. We have presented the light curves and the classification of\nthose variables. The periodic stars have periods ranging from $\\sim$0.05 days\nto $\\sim$3.00 days and amplitude ranges from $\\sim$8 mmag to $\\sim$700 mmag.\nThe nonperiodic stars show variation from $\\sim$30 mmag to $\\sim$500 mmag. The\nperiodic stars include main-sequence pulsating variables such as Slow Pulsating\nB-type, $\\delta$ Scuti, RR Lyrae, and $\\gamma$ Doradus. We report a detached\nbinary system and rotating variables similar to BY Draconis-type stars\nexhibiting variable brightness caused by starspots, chromospheric activity, and\nmagnetic field-related phenomena.\n",

      "title": "Very-wide-orbit planets from dynamical instabilities during the stellar\n  birth cluster phase",
      "summary": "  Gas giant planets have been detected on eccentric orbits several hundreds of\nastronomical units in size around other stars. It has been proposed that even\nthe Sun hosts a wide-orbit planet of 5-10 Earth masses, often called Planet\nNine, which influences the dynamics of distant Trans-Neptunian objects.\nHowever, the formation mechanism of such planets remains uncertain. Here we use\nnumerical simulations to show that very wide-orbit planets are a natural\nbyproduct of dynamical instabilities that occur in planetary systems while\ntheir host stars are still embedded in natal stellar clusters. A planet is\nfirst brought to an eccentric orbit with an apoastron of several hundred au by\nrepeated gravitational scattering by other planets, then perturbations from\nnearby stellar flybys stabilise the orbit by decoupling the planet from the\ninteraction with the inner system. In our Solar System, the two main events\nlikely conducive to planetary scattering were the growth of Uranus and Neptune,\nand the giant planets instability. We estimate a 5-10% likelihood of creating a\nvery wide-orbit planet if either happened while the Sun was still in its birth\ncluster, rising to 40% if both were. In our simulated exoplanetary systems, the\ntrapping efficiency is 1-5\\%. Our results imply that planets on wide, eccentric\norbits occur at least $10^{-3}$ per star.\n",

      "title": "Gas meets Kozai: the influence of a gas-rich accretion disc on\n  hierarchical triples undergoing von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai oscillations",
      "summary": "  Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) consist of a central supermassive black hole\n(SMBH) embedded in a region with both high gas and stellar densities: the gas\nis present as a thin accretion disc that fuels the central SMBH, while the\nstars form a dense, roughly isotropic nuclear star cluster. The binaries\npresent in such a cluster could be considered naturally as triples, with the\nSMBH as a third object, and their dynamics also depend on the interaction with\nthe gas-rich disc. In this paper, we study the evolution of such a binary on an\ninclined orbit with respect to the disc. The binary experiences both\neccentricity excitation via the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) effect and drag\nforces from each time it penetrates the disc. We find that, as the outer\norbital inclination decreases, the evolution of inner orbital separation can\ntransition from a regime of gradual hardening to a regime of rapid softening.\nAs such binaries grow wider, their minimum pericentre distances (during ZLK\noscillations) decrease. We show that a simple geometric condition, modulated by\nthe complex ZLK evolution, dictates whether a binary expands or contracts due\nto the interactions with the AGN disc. Our results suggest that the interaction\nwith gas-rich accretion disc could enhance the rate of stellar mergers and\nformation of gravitational wave sources, as well as other transients. The\ntreatment introduced here is general and could apply, with the proper\nmodifications, to hierarchical triples in other gas-rich systems.\n",

      "title": "Hydrodynamic simulations of black hole evolution in AGN discs I: orbital\n  alignment of highly inclined satellites",
      "summary": "  The frequency of compact object interactions in AGN discs is naturally tied\nto the number of objects embedded within it. We investigate the evolution of\nblack holes in the nuclear stellar cluster on inclined orbits to the AGN disc\nby performing adiabatic hydrodynamical simulations of isolated black hole disc\ncrossings over a range of disc densities and inclinations\n$i\\in[2^\\circ,15^\\circ]$. We find radiation dominates the pressure in the wake\nthat forms around the BH across the full inclination and disc density range. We\nidentify no well defined steady state wake morphology due to the thin geometry\nof the disc and the vertical exponential density drop off, where the wake\nmorphology depends on the vertical depth of the transit within the disc. The\ninclination damping $\\Delta i$ relative the pre-transit inclination behaves as\na power law in $\\sin(i)$ and the ambient Hill mass $m_\\text{H,0}$ as $\\Delta\ni/i \\propto m_{\\rm H,0}^{0.4} \\sin(i)^{-2.7}$. The drag on the BH is dominated\nby the gravity of the wake for the majority of our inclination range until\naccretion effects become comparable at $\\sin(i)\\gtrsim30H_0/R_0$, where\n$H_0/R_0$ is the disc aspect ratio. At low inclinations\n($\\sin(i)\\lesssim3H_0/R_0$) the wake morphology becomes more spherical, leading\nto a regime change in the inclination damping behaviour. Our results suggest\nthat the inclination damping timescale is shorter than expected from only\nepisodic Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttelton accretion events during each transit, implying\ninclined objects may captured by the AGN disc earlier in its lifetime than\npreviously thought.\n",

      "title": "Stellar Mass Segregation in Dark Matter Halos",
      "summary": "  We study the effect of stellar mass segregation driven by collisional\nrelaxation within the potential well of a smooth dark matter halo. This effect\nis of particular relevance for old stellar systems with short crossing times,\nwhere small collisional perturbations accumulate over many dynamical time\nscales. We run collisional $N$-body simulations tailored to the ambiguous\nstellar systems Ursa Major 3/Unions 1, Delve 1 and Eridanus 3, modelling their\nstellar populations as two-component systems of high- and low-mass stars,\nrespectively. For Ursa Major 3/Unions 1 (Delve 1), assuming a\ndynamical-to-stellar mass ratio of 10, we find that after 10 Gyr of evolution,\nthe radial extent of its low-mass stars will be twice as large (40 per cent\nlarger) than that of its high-mass stars. We show that weak tides do not alter\nthis relative separation of half-light radii, whereas for the case of strong\ntidal fields, mass segregation facilitates the tidal stripping of low-mass\nstars. We further find that as the population of high-mass stars contracts and\ncools, the number of dynamically formed binaries within that population\nincreases. Our results call for caution when using stellar mass segregation as\na criterion to separate star clusters from dwarf galaxies, and suggest that\nmass segregation increases the abundance of massive binaries in the central\nregions of dark matter-dominated dwarf galaxies.\n",

      "title": "Spectral Evolution of Rotating Population III Stars",
      "summary": "  Population III (Pop III) stars, the first generation of stars formed from\nprimordial gas, played a fundamental role in shaping the early universe through\ntheir influence on cosmic reionization, early chemical enrichment, and the\nformation of the first galaxies. However, to date they have eluded direct\ndetection due to their short lifetimes and high redshifts. The launch of the\nJames Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revolutionized observational\ncapabilities, providing the opportunity to detect Pop~III stars via caustic\nlensing, where strong gravitational lensing magnifies individual stars to\nobservable levels. This prospect makes it compelling to develop accurate models\nfor their spectral characteristics to distinguish them from other stellar\npopulations. Previous studies have focused on computing the spectral properties\nof non-rotating, zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) Pop III stars. In this work, we\nexpand upon these efforts by incorporating the effects of stellar rotation and\npost-ZAMS evolution into spectral calculations. We use the JWST bands and\nmagnitude limits to identify the optimal observing conditions, both for\nisolated stars, as well as for small star clusters. We find that, while\nrotation does not appreciably change the observability at ZAMS, the subsequent\nevolution can significantly brighten the stars, making the most massive ones\npotentially visible with only moderate lensing.\n",

      "title": "The TYPHOON Stellar Population Synthesis Survey. II. Pushing Full\n  Spectral Fitting to the Limit in the Nearby Grand Design Barred Spiral M83",
      "summary": "  We apply population synthesis techniques to analyze TYPHOON long slit spectra\nof the starburst barred spiral galaxy M83. The analysis covers a central square\nof 5 arcmin side length. We determine the spatial distribution of dust through\nthe analysis of reddening and extinction, together with star formation rates,\nages, and metallicities of young and old stellar populations. For the first\ntime, a spatial one-to-one comparison of metallicities derived from\nfull-spectral fitting techniques with those obtained from individual young\nstellar probes has been carried out. The comparison with blue supergiant stars,\nyoung massive star clusters, and super star clusters shows a high degree of\nconcordance when wavelength coverage in the $B$-band is available. The\nmetallicity of the young population is supersolar and does not show a radial\nmetallicity gradient along the investigated part of the disk, in agreement with\nour chemical evolution model. However, a notable decrease in metallicity is\nobserved in a tightly confined region at the galaxy center, coinciding with\ncircumnuclear orbits. We attribute this to matter infall either from the\ncircumgalactic medium or a dwarf galaxy interloper or, alternatively, to\nAGN-interrupted chemical evolution. We confirm the presence of a dust cavity\nwith a diameter of 260~pc close to the galaxy center. Dust absorption and\nmolecular CO emission are spatially well correlated. We find an anticorrelation\nbetween R$_V$, the ratio of dust attenuation to reddening, and the emission\nstrength of molecular species present in photo-dissociation regions. We confirm\nour results by using alternative fitting algorithms and stellar libraries.\n",
