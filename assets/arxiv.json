      "title": "KRIOS: A new basis-expansion $N$-body code for collisional stellar\n  dynamics",
      "summary": "  The gravitational $N$-body problem is a nearly universal problem in\nastrophysics which, despite its deceptive simplicity, still presents a\nsignificant computational challenge. For collisional systems such as dense star\nclusters, the need to resolve individual encounters between $N$ stars makes the\ndirect summation of forces - with quadratic complexity - almost infeasible for\nsystems with $N\\gtrsim 10^6$ particles over many relaxation times. At the same\ntime, the most common Monte Carlo $N$-body algorithm - that of H\\'enon -\nassumes the cluster to be spherically symmetric. This greatly limits the study\nof many important features of star clusters, including triaxiality, rotation,\nand the production of tidal debris. In this paper, we present a new hybrid\ncode, KRIOS, that combines 3D collisionless relaxation using an adaptive\nself-consistent field method with a collisional dynamics part handled via\nH\\'enon's method. We demonstrate that KRIOS can accurately model the long-term\nevolution of clusters and provide its complete phase-space information over\nmany relaxation times. As a test of our new code, we present detailed\ncomparisons to two well-known results from stellar dynamics: (i) the\ncollisional evolution of an isotropic Plummer sphere to core collapse, and (ii)\nthe emergence of the radial-orbit instability in radially anisotropic star\nclusters, including its non-spherical effects.\n",

      "title": "Stellar initial mass function in the 100-pc solar neighbourhood",
      "summary": "  The stellar initial mass function (IMF) is one of the most important\nastrophysical distribution function, and is defined as the mass distribution\nfor stars formed in a single star-formation event and when they just enter the\nmain-sequence stage. The measurement of IMF is challenging even in the solar\nneighbourhood where IMF can be extracted by star-counting. This is because the\ndefinition of the IMF should be handled cautiously, and there are multiple\ncorrections should be made from observation to a well-founded measurement. We\npresent a new parametrisation of the stellar IMF in the 100-pc solar\nneighbourhood, leveraging the astrometric and photometric data from\n\\textsl{Gaia} DR3: we model the colour-magnitude diagram of the field star\npopulation while accounting for observational uncertainties, Malmquist bias,\nLutz-Kelker bias, the effect of varying mass-luminosity relation caused by\nmixture of different metallicity, and the effect of unresolved binaries. In\nparticular, we synthesise the binaries with a process imitating the dynamical\nevolution observed in star clusters to model their present-day mass-ratio\ndistribution. We derive a stellar IMF consistent with canonical IMFs but with\nsignificantly reduced uncertainties: $\\alpha_1=0.81^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$,\n$\\alpha_2=2.12^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$, and a break point at\n$m_{\\mathrm{break}}=0.41^{+0.01}_{-0.01}$ $\\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$. Our model also\nconstrains the binary fraction to $\\sim$25\\% and the \\textsl{Gaia} DR3 angular\nresolution to $1.31^{+0.24}_{-0.29}$ arcsec. We also provide the\n$\\xi$-parameter for our IMF to be $0.5075_{-0.0051}^{+0.0112}$ for the users to\ncompare our result with other work.\n",

      "title": "From FFB Starbursts at Cosmic Dawn to Quenching at Cosmic Morning: Hi-z\n  Galaxy Bimodality",
      "summary": "  We propose a mass-dependent bimodality in the early evolution of galaxies.\nThe massive track connects the super-bright galaxies at cosmic dawn ($z>8$) to\nthe super-massive quiescent galaxies and black holes (BHs) at cosmic morning\n($z=4-7$). The dark-matter halos $>10^{10.5}M_\\odot$ at $z=10$ are expected to\nundergo feedback-free starbursts (FFB) with high star-formation efficiency in\ndense star clusters within compact galaxies. The less massive halos avoid FFB\nand form stars gradually under stellar feedback, leading to the peak\nstar-forming galaxies at cosmic noon ($z=1-3$). The FFB and non-FFB halos\noriginate from $>4\\sigma$ and $2-3\\sigma$ density peaks, respectively. The\npost-FFB galaxies quench their star formation soon after the FFB phase and\nremain quiescent due to (a) gas depletion by the FFB starbursts and outflows,\n(b) compaction events driven by angular-momentum loss in colliding streams\nwithin the high-sigma-peak FFB halos, (c) turbulent circum-galactic medium\n(CGM) that suppresses feeding by cold streams, and (d) BH feedback, being a key\nfor complete quenching. BH feedback is enhanced by FFB-driven BH seeding and\ngrowth. It seems capable of disrupting the streams by generating CGM turbulence\nor photo-heating, but this remains an open challenge. The cosmic-morning\nquiescent galaxies are expected to be massive, compact, showing signatures of\ncompaction, outflows and AGN, with a comoving number density $\\sim 10^{-5} {\\rm\nMpc}^{-3}$, comparable to the super-bright galaxies at cosmic dawn and the AGN\nat cosmic morning. Their UV luminosity function should peak about $M_{\\rm uv}\n\\sim -22$ and contribute $\\sim 10\\%$ of the galaxies there.\n",

      "title": "Open clusters in the outer disc studied with MEGARA@GTC Auner 1 and\n  Berkeley 102",
      "summary": "  Open clusters offer crucial insights into stellar nucleosynthesis and the\nchemical evolution of the Galactic disc, as their ages and distances can be\ndetermined with higher accuracy compared to field stars. In this study, we\ninvestigate the outermost regions of the Milky Way disc using two previously\nunstudied open clusters -Auner 1 and Berkeley 102- located at Galactocentric\ndistances of approximately 14 kpc in largely uncharted areas of the Galaxy. We\nobtained medium-resolution spectra (R > 18,700) using the MEGARA integral-field\nunit (IFU) spectrograph on the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC), targeting\nred giant member stars in both clusters. From these spectra, we derived radial\nvelocities, stellar atmospheric parameters, and chemical abundances for six\nelements: Fe, Ca, Co, Ni, Ba, and Eu. Additionally, we provide updated\nestimates of the clusters' ages and distances. Both clusters are old (3.2 +-\n0.7 Ga), distant (d ~ 8 kpc), and lie below the Galactic plane (Z Gal ~ -0.7\nkpc), with moderate extinction (AV ~ 1.3 mag). We find that Auner 1 has a\nmetallicity of [Fe/H] = -0.30 +- 0.09 and Berkeley 102 of [Fe/H] = -0.35 +-\n0.06, consistent with other clusters at similar Galactocentric radii and\nindicating minimal azimuthal variation in metallicity. The [X/Fe] abundance\nratios align with expected trends, although [Ca/Fe] is slightly higher in both\nclusters, and [Eu/Fe] is notably enhanced in Berkeley 102 ([Eu/Fe] = 0.64 +-\n0.05). Our findings highlight the effectiveness of GTC/MEGARA in IFU mode for\nGalactic archaeology and emphasize the need for further medium-to-high\nresolution spectroscopic studies of remote open clusters to refine models of\nthe outer Galactic disc's chemical evolution.\n",

      "title": "Counterculture Stars: Slow and Retrograde Stars with Low-Alpha Disk\n  Abundances",
      "summary": "  The Milky Way is home to a thin disk that can be defined via kinematics\nand/or elemental abundances. The elemental abundance-defined thin disk, also\ncalled the low-alpha disk, is generally thought to be comprised of stars on\nplanar, circular orbits that approximate the circular velocity curve. While\nthis is an apt description for the majority of stars with thin-disk-like\nabundances, there are a number of interesting exceptions. In this analysis, we\nidentify and investigate $\\sim 70$ stars with thin-disk-like abundances and\nvery slow or retrograde Galactocentric azimuthal velocities. These stars could\nbe kinematical outliers of the thin disk or elemental abundance outliers of the\nhalo. Focusing first on the former, we introduce a number of mechanisms that\ncould alter a thin disk orbit and cause the azimuthal velocity to become slow\nor retrograde. We then determine signatures for each mechanism and assess\nwhether that mechanism is unlikely, plausible, or consistent given each star's\nreported properties. We find that at least one mechanism is plausible for each\nstar, and the mechanism with the highest number of consistent candidate stars\nis dynamical ejection from stellar clusters. We next discuss scenarios that\ncould produce halo stars with thin disk abundances, and again identify stars\nthat could be connected to these mechanisms. With this sample we investigate\nrare processes, such as binary disruption by the central supermassive black\nhole, while also providing a unique perspective into the chemo-dynamics and\nstructural components of the Milky Way.\n",

      "title": "Deriving physical parameters of unresolved star clusters. IX. Sky\n  background effects in the aperture photometry",
      "summary": "  The aperture photometry method is a powerful tool that enables us to study\nlarge star cluster systems efficiently. However, its accuracy depends on\nvarious factors, including the stochasticity of the stellar initial mass\nfunction and variations in the sky background. Previously, in the eighth paper\nof this series, we established the best achievable limits of the aperture\nphotometry method for star cluster studies in the local universe. The aim of\nthis study is to determine how the sky background affects the limits and\napplicability of the aperture photometry method in star cluster analysis. We\nused a large sample of star cluster models spanning the parameter space of M 31\nclusters. To determine how the background affects star cluster photometry, we\nplaced images of simulated clusters into five background fields of different\nstellar density from the Panchromatic $Hubble$ Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey\nand measured them using aperture photometry. We determined age and mass limits\nfor the M 31 disc star clusters at which photometric uncertainties are low\nenough to enable the determination of cluster parameters using the aperture\nphotometry method. We demonstrated that for typical-size clusters, optimal\naperture diameters are of ~3 half-light radii. We assessed cluster detection\ncompleteness in relation to varying sky background densities, based on the M 31\nPHAT survey data. Our results suggest that a significant selection bias towards\nmore compact clusters may exist in the PHAT survey. We derived low-mass limits\nof the cluster mass function (CMF) in the PHAT survey, reaching down to masses\nof ~500 $M_\\odot$ in outer disc areas, ~1500 $M_\\odot$ in middle disc or\nstar-forming regions, and ~3000 $M_\\odot$ in inner disc regions. Therefore, we\nstress a necessity of careful accounting for selection effects arising due to\nsky background variations when studying the CMF.\n",
