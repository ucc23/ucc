      "title": "Symbiotic stars in Galactic open clusters",
      "summary": "  The age determination of symbiotic stars is essential to put further\nconstraints on models explaining these binary systems. In the Galactic field,\nthis is especially problematic because of several limitations due to reddening\nestimations, for example. We searched for symbiotic stars as members of\nGalactic open clusters for which the age and overall metallicity can be\ndetermined in a statistical sense. The most recent lists of well-established\nand candidate symbiotic stars and open clusters were matched, and we found\nseven good candidates from which the well-established symbiotic star CQ Dra\nseems to be a true member of the old open cluster HSC 1224. The\ncolour-magnitude diagrams for the other candidates raise some doubts about\nmembership.\n",

      "title": "Ultraviolet photon production rates of the first stars: Impact on the He\n  II $λ$ 1640 Å emission line from primordial star clusters and the\n  21-cm signal from cosmic dawn",
      "summary": "  The first stars, the chemically pristine Population III, likely played an\nimportant role in heating the intergalactic medium during the epoch of cosmic\ndawn. The very high effective temperatures ($\\sim 10^5$ K) predicted for the\nmost massive Population III stars could also give rise to tell-tale signatures\nin the emission-line spectra of early star clusters or small galaxies dominated\nby such stars. Important quantities in modelling their observational signatures\ninclude their photon production rates at ultraviolet energies at which photons\nare able to ionize hydrogen and helium, dissociate molecular hydrogen and cause\nLyman-$\\alpha$ heating. Here, we model the spectral energy distributions of\nPopulation III stars to explore how these key quantities are affected by the\ninitial mass and rotation of Population III stars given a wide range of models\nfor the evolution of these stars. Our results indicate that rotating Population\nIII stars that evolve to effective temperatures $\\sim 2\\times 10^5$ K could\npotentially give rise to a very strong HeII 1640 emission line in the spectra\nfrom primordial star clusters, without requiring stellar masses of $\\gtrsim\n100\\ \\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ indicated by previous models for non-rotating Population\nIII stars. At the same time, the observable impact on 21-cm signatures from\ncosmic dawn and epoch of reionization from our set of rotating stars that\nevolve to $\\sim 2\\times 10^5$ K are modest, and produce potentially detectable\nfeatures in the global 21-cm signal and 21-cm power spectrum for high\nPopulation III star formation efficiencies only.\n",

      "title": "A hidden link in the LMC star cluster formation history",
      "summary": "  The age distribution function of star clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud\n(LMC) is known to present a feature called the cluster age gap, a period of\ntime from ~ 4 to 11 Gyr ago with a remarkable small number of clusters\nidentified. In this work we performed an in-depth analysis of three recently\ncatalogued age gap cluster candidates with the aim of confirming their physical\nnature. We used GEMINI@GMOS g,i photometry centred on the objects to build\ncolour-magnitude diagrams from which we recognised their main features. We also\nperformed an automatic search of stellar overdensities using Gaussian mixture\nmodel techniques and analysed the corresponding colour-magnitude diagrams\nsimilarly as performed for the aforementioned candidates. The present GEMINI\ndata sets would seem to discard any strong evidence of these object being real\nclusters, and rather support the possibility of the result of stellar density\nvariations of the LMC field star distribution. These three objects, in addition\nto other 17 new identified candidates, are placed in the LMC outermost disc in\na limited region toward the southwest from the LMC centre. They had embraced\nthe possibility to answer the long-time conundrum about the absence of LMC age\ngap clusters. From an statistical approach, combined with the knowledge of the\nexpected LMC age-metallicity relationship, and recent simulations of the\ninteraction between the LMC and the Milky Way, we provide not only evidence\nagainst the physical nature of the studied objects, but also an interpretation\non the lack of identification of more LMC age gap clusters.\n",
