      "title": "Spatial mixing of stellar populations in globular clusters via\n  binary-single star scattering",
      "summary": "  The majority of Galactic globular star clusters (GCs) have been reported to\ncontain at least two populations of stars (we use P1 for the primordial and P2\nfor the chemically-enriched population). Recent observational studies found\nthat dynamically-old GCs have P1 and P2 spatially mixed due to relaxation\nprocesses. However, in dynamically-young GCs, where P2 is expected to be more\ncentrally concentrated from birth, the spatial distributions of P1 and P2 are\nsometimes very different from system to system. This suggests that more complex\ndynamical processes specific to certain GCs might have shaped those\ndistributions. We aim to investigate the discrepancies between the spatial\nconcentration of P1 and P2 stars in dynamically-young GCs. Our focus is to\nevaluate whether massive binary stars (e.g. BHs) can cause the expansion of the\nP2 stars through binary-single interactions in the core, and whether they can\nmix or even radially invert the P1 and P2 distributions. We use a set of\ntheoretical and empirical arguments to evaluate the effectiveness of\nbinary-single star scattering. We then construct a set of direct N-body models\nwith massive primordial binaries to verify our estimates further and gain more\ninsights into the dynamical processes in GCs. We find that binary-single star\nscatterings can push the central P2 stars outwards within a few relaxation\ntimes. While we do not produce radial inversion of P1 and P2 for any initial\nconditions we tested, this mechanism systematically produces clusters where P1\nand P2 look fully mixed even in projection. The mixing is enhanced 1) in denser\nGCs, 2) in GCs containing more binary stars, and 3) when the mass ratio between\nthe binary components and the cluster members is higher. Binary-single star\ninteractions seem able to explain the observable properties of some\ndynamically-young GCs (e.g. NGC4590 or NGC5904) where P1 and P2 are fully\nradially mixed.\n",

      "title": "PARSEC V2.0: Rotating tracks and isochrones for seven addtional\n  metallicities in the range Z=0.0001-0.03",
      "summary": "  PARSEC v2.0 rotating stellar tracks were previously presented for six values\nof metallicity from subsolar to solar values, with initial rotation rates\n($\\omega_\\mathrm{i}$, defined as the ratio of angular velocity and its critical\nvalue) spanning from the non-rotating case to very near the critical velocity\n(i.e. $\\omega_\\mathrm{i}=0.99$), and for initial masses covering the $\\sim 0.7\nM_\\odot$ to $14 M_\\odot$ interval. Furthermore, we provided the corresponding\nisochrones converted into several photometric systems, for different\ninclination angles between the line-of-sight and the rotation axes, from\n$0^\\circ$ (pole-on) to $90^\\circ$ (equator-on). In this work, we expand this\ndatabase with seven other sets of metallicity, including five sets of low\nmetallicity ($Z=0.0001-0.002$) and two sets of super-solar values (up to\n$Z=0.03$). Here, we present the new stellar tracks, comprising $\\sim$3\\,040\ntracks in total ($\\sim$5\\,500 including previous sets), along with the new\ncorresponding rotating isochrones. We also introduce the possibility of\ncreating isochrones, by interpolation, for values of rotating rates not\navailable in the initial set of tracks. We compare a selection of our new\nmodels with rotating stellar tracks from the Geneva Stellar Evolution Code, and\nwe assess the quality of our new tracks by fitting the colour-magnitude diagram\nof the open cluster NGC6067. We take advantage of the projected rotational\nvelocity of member stars measured by Gaia to validate our results and examine\nthe surface oxygen abundances in comparison with the observed data. All newly\ncomputed stellar tracks and isochrones are retrievable via our dedicated web\ndatabases and interfaces.\n",

We describe the stellar parameter pipeline for the SDSS-V halo survey,\nwhich simultaneously models spectra, broadband photometry, and parallaxes to\nderive stellar parameters, metallicities, alpha abundances, and distances. The\nresulting BOSS-MINESweeper catalog is validated across a wide range of stellar\nparameters and metallicities using star clusters and a comparison to\nhigh-resolution spectroscopic surveys. We demonstrate several scientific\ncapabilities of this dataset: identifying the most chemically peculiar stars in\nour Galaxy, discovering and mapping distant halo substructures, and measuring\nthe all--sky dynamics of the Milky Way on the largest scales. The\nBOSS-MINESweeper catalog for SDSS DR19 is publicly available and will be\nupdated for future data releases.\n",

      "summary": "  Estimating properties of star clusters from unresolved broadband photometry\nis a challenging problem that is classically tackled by spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) fitting methods that are based on simple stellar population\n(SSP) models. However, because of their exponential scaling, grid-based methods\nsuffer from computational limitations. In addition, stochastic latent variables\nin the model can make the computation of the likelihood function intractable.\nThese limitations can be overcome by modern generative deep learning methods\nthat offer flexible and powerful tools for modeling high-dimensional posterior\ndistributions and fast inference from learned data. We present a normalizing\nflow approach for the inference of cluster age, mass, and reddening from Hubble\nSpace Telescope (HST) broadband photometry. In particular, we explore our\nnetwork's behavior on an inference problem that has been analyzed in previous\nworks. We used the SED modeling code CIGALE to create a dataset of synthetic\nphotometric observations for $5 \\times 10^6$ mock star clusters. Subsequently,\nthis data set was used to train a coupling-based flow in the form of a\nconditional invertible neural network (cINN) to predict posterior probability\ndistributions for cluster age, mass, and reddening from photometric\nobservations. We predicted cluster parameters for the 'Physics at High Angular\nresolution in Nearby GalaxieS' (PHANGS) Data Release 3 catalog. To evaluate the\ncapabilities of the network, we compared our results to the publicly available\nPHANGS estimates and found that the estimates agree reasonably well. We\ndemonstrate that normalizing flow methods can be a viable tool for the\ninference of cluster parameters, and argue that this approach is especially\nuseful when latent variables make the computation of the likelihood intractable\nand in scenarios that require efficient density estimation.\n",
