      "title": "PARSEC V2.0: Rotating tracks and isochrones for seven addtional\n  metallicities in the range Z=0.0001-0.03",
      "summary": "  PARSEC v2.0 rotating stellar tracks were previously presented for six values\nof metallicity from subsolar to solar values, with initial rotation rates\n($\\omega_\\mathrm{i}$, defined as the ratio of angular velocity and its critical\nvalue) spanning from the non-rotating case to very near the critical velocity\n(i.e. $\\omega_\\mathrm{i}=0.99$), and for initial masses covering the $\\sim 0.7\nM_\\odot$ to $14 M_\\odot$ interval. Furthermore, we provided the corresponding\nisochrones converted into several photometric systems, for different\ninclination angles between the line-of-sight and the rotation axes, from\n$0^\\circ$ (pole-on) to $90^\\circ$ (equator-on). In this work, we expand this\ndatabase with seven other sets of metallicity, including five sets of low\nmetallicity ($Z=0.0001-0.002$) and two sets of super-solar values (up to\n$Z=0.03$). Here, we present the new stellar tracks, comprising $\\sim$3\\,040\ntracks in total ($\\sim$5\\,500 including previous sets), along with the new\ncorresponding rotating isochrones. We also introduce the possibility of\ncreating isochrones, by interpolation, for values of rotating rates not\navailable in the initial set of tracks. We compare a selection of our new\nmodels with rotating stellar tracks from the Geneva Stellar Evolution Code, and\nwe assess the quality of our new tracks by fitting the colour-magnitude diagram\nof the open cluster NGC6067. We take advantage of the projected rotational\nvelocity of member stars measured by Gaia to validate our results and examine\nthe surface oxygen abundances in comparison with the observed data. All newly\ncomputed stellar tracks and isochrones are retrievable via our dedicated web\ndatabases and interfaces.\n",

      "title": "A normalizing flow approach for the inference of star cluster properties\n  from unresolved broadband photometry I: Comparison to spectral energy\n  distribution fitting",
      "summary": "  Estimating properties of star clusters from unresolved broadband photometry\nis a challenging problem that is classically tackled by spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) fitting methods that are based on simple stellar population\n(SSP) models. However, because of their exponential scaling, grid-based methods\nsuffer from computational limitations. In addition, stochastic latent variables\nin the model can make the computation of the likelihood function intractable.\nThese limitations can be overcome by modern generative deep learning methods\nthat offer flexible and powerful tools for modeling high-dimensional posterior\ndistributions and fast inference from learned data. We present a normalizing\nflow approach for the inference of cluster age, mass, and reddening from Hubble\nSpace Telescope (HST) broadband photometry. In particular, we explore our\nnetwork's behavior on an inference problem that has been analyzed in previous\nworks. We used the SED modeling code CIGALE to create a dataset of synthetic\nphotometric observations for $5 \\times 10^6$ mock star clusters. Subsequently,\nthis data set was used to train a coupling-based flow in the form of a\nconditional invertible neural network (cINN) to predict posterior probability\ndistributions for cluster age, mass, and reddening from photometric\nobservations. We predicted cluster parameters for the 'Physics at High Angular\nresolution in Nearby GalaxieS' (PHANGS) Data Release 3 catalog. To evaluate the\ncapabilities of the network, we compared our results to the publicly available\nPHANGS estimates and found that the estimates agree reasonably well. We\ndemonstrate that normalizing flow methods can be a viable tool for the\ninference of cluster parameters, and argue that this approach is especially\nuseful when latent variables make the computation of the likelihood intractable\nand in scenarios that require efficient density estimation.\n",

The\naverage extinction (AV), measured from the J-H color, of sources is 19 AV in\nW51 IRS2 and 14 AV in W51 Main. We document 17 new instances of H2 emission in\nthe region by utilizing observations from the H2(1-0) narrow-band filter.\nDespite limited completeness, we estimated masses for each cluster member and\nestimated the total cluster mass to be in the range of 900-4700 solar masses\nfor W51 IRS2 and 500-2700 solar masses for W51 Main, using an assumed age range\nof 1-3 Myr. We measured the initial mass function (IMF) in the proto-clusters\nassuming a range of ages from 1-3 Myr and found that the IMF slopes for both\nproto-clusters are consistent with the Salpeter IMF in the mass range greater\nthan or equal to 8 solar masses within 1 to 2 sigma.\n",

      "summary": "  The first stars, the chemically pristine Population III, likely played an\nimportant role in heating the intergalactic medium during the epoch of cosmic\ndawn. The very high effective temperatures ($\\sim 10^5$ K) predicted for the\nmost massive Population III stars could also give rise to tell-tale signatures\nin the emission-line spectra of early star clusters or small galaxies dominated\nby such stars. Important quantities in modelling their observational signatures\ninclude their photon production rates at ultraviolet energies at which photons\nare able to ionize hydrogen and helium, dissociate molecular hydrogen and cause\nLyman-$\\alpha$ heating. Here, we model the spectral energy distributions of\nPopulation III stars to explore how these key quantities are affected by the\ninitial mass and rotation of Population III stars given a wide range of models\nfor the evolution of these stars. Our results indicate that rotating Population\nIII stars that evolve to effective temperatures $\\sim 2\\times 10^5$ K could\npotentially give rise to a very strong HeII 1640 emission line in the spectra\nfrom primordial star clusters, without requiring stellar masses of $\\gtrsim\n100\\ \\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ indicated by previous models for non-rotating Population\nIII stars. At the same time, the observable impact on 21-cm signatures from\ncosmic dawn and epoch of reionization from our set of rotating stars that\nevolve to $\\sim 2\\times 10^5$ K are modest, and produce potentially detectable\nfeatures in the global 21-cm signal and 21-cm power spectrum for high\nPopulation III star formation efficiencies only.\n",
