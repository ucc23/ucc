      "summary": "  Aims. We investigate the gas reservoirs, star formation (SF) properties, and\nenvironment of the ultra-diffuse galaxy GAMA526784 to understand its formation\nhistory, the efficiency of molecular gas conversion into stars, and the\npossible role of an interacting companion in shaping its morphology. Methods.\nWe analyse low and high-resolution CO observations to constrain the molecular\ngas content, compare with HI data, and examine the SF efficiency of GAMA526784.\nThe potential influence of a newly identified nearby dwarf galaxy is assessed\nusing photometric and spatial information. Results. GAMA526784 exhibits a\nregular HI reservoir (M_HI/M* = 2.88) but only upper limits on its molecular\ngas mass (M_H2(5sigma)/M* < 0.23). The HI reservoir and CO non-detection can be\nexplained by several mechanisms: (1) predominance of CO-dark H2, invisible to\nCO observations but contributing to SF; (2) a time delay in HI-to-H2 conversion\nfollowing a recent interaction; or (3) elevated turbulence inhibiting gas\ncollapse. An identified companion, found at a projected distance of 48 kpc,\nshows similar colours and lies in the direction of young star clusters in\nGAMA526784, indicating a possible association. We hypothesise this companion\nmay have triggered the formation of star clusters in GAMA526784 through a\nhigh-velocity encounter. Conclusions. Our findings suggest GAMA526784 may have\nundergone an interaction that influenced its gas reservoirs and SF activity.\nThe presence of a nearby companion agrees with predictions of a high-speed\nencounter, potentially offering a rare example of such an interaction in\nprogress. We suggest this encounter may have shaped the system's recent\nevolution. Future observations, particularly targeting molecular gas tracers\nbeyond CO and resolved HI maps, will be crucial in determining the extent of\nGAMA526784's cold gas reservoir and the nature of its recent star formation.\n",

      "title": "Open Cluster Members in the APOGEE DR17. I. Dynamics and Star Members",
      "summary": "  Context. Open clusters are groups of stars formed from the same cloud of gas\nand cosmic dust. They play an important role in studying stars' formation and\nevolution and understanding galaxies' structure and dynamics. Aims. The main\nobjective of this work is to identify stars that belong to open clusters using\nastrometric data from Gaia EDR3 and spectroscopic data from APOGEE DR17.\nFurthermore, we investigate the metallicity gradients and orbital properties of\nthe open clusters in our sample. Methods. By applying the HDBSCAN clustering\nalgorithm to this data, we identified observed stars in our galaxy with similar\ndynamics, chemical compositions, and ages. The orbits of the open clusters were\nalso calculated using the GravPot16 code. Results. We found 1987 stars\nbelonging to 49 open clusters, and 941 of these stars have probabilities above\n80 % of belonging to open clusters. Our metallicity gradient presents a\ntwo-slope shape for two measures of different Galactic center distances, the\nprojected Galactocentric distance, and the guiding center radius to the\nGalactic Center, as already reported in previous work. However, when we\nseparate the open clusters by age, we observe no significant difference in the\nmetallicity gradient slope beyond a certain distance from the Galactic center.\nOur results show a shallower gradient for clusters younger than 2 Gyr than\nthose older than 2 Gyr. All our OCs dynamically assemble the Disk-like\npopulation very well, and they are in prograde orbits, which is typical for\ndisk-like populations. Some OCs resonate with the Galactic bar at the Lagrange\npoints L4 and L5.\n",

      "title": "Line ratio identification of external photoevaporation",
      "summary": "  External photoevaporation of protoplanetary discs, by massive O stars in\nstellar clusters, is thought to be a significant process in the evolution of a\ndisc. It has been shown to result in significant mass loss and disc truncation,\nultimately reducing the lifetime of the discs, and possibly affecting potential\nplanet populations. It is a well-studied process in the Orion Nebula Cluster\n(ONC) where the cometary morphology of proplyds is spatially resolvable due to\nits proximity to Earth. However, we need to study external photoevaporation in\nadditional stellar clusters to better understand its prevalence and\nsignificance more globally. Unfortunately, more massive stellar clusters where\nthe majority of stars form are much farther away than the ONC. In these more\ndistant clusters the proplyds are spatially unresolvable with current\nfacilities, hence the cometary morphology is not a useful identification of\nexternal photoevaporation. Therefore, in order to identify and interpret\nexternal photoevaporation, the only observations we have are of spatially\nunresolved emission lines. To resolve this issue we have used the CLOUDY code\nto develop an approximate general model of the emission lines emanating from\nthe hot ionized wind of a proplyd. We have used the model to determine which\nline ratios are most sensitive to the distance from an OB star, and found that\nthe most sensitive line ratios vary by multiple orders of magnitude over an FUV\nfield of between 10$^3$ G$_0$ to 10$^6$ G$_0$. By identifying spatial gradients\nof line ratios in stellar clusters, we can identify regions of ongoing external\nphotoevaporation.\n",

      "title": "The completeness of the open cluster census towards the Galactic\n  anticentre",
      "summary": "  Open clusters have long been used as tracers of Galactic structure. However,\nwithout a selection function to describe the completeness of the cluster\ncensus, it is difficult to quantitatively interpret their distribution. We\ncreate a method to empirically determine the selection function of a Galactic\ncluster catalogue. We test it by investigating the completeness of the cluster\ncensus in the outer Milky Way, where old and young clusters exhibit different\nspatial distributions. We develop a method to generate realistic mock clusters\nas a function of their parameters, in addition to accounting for Gaia's\nselection function and astrometric errors. We then inject mock clusters into\nGaia DR3 data, and attempt to recover them in a blind search using HDBSCAN. We\nfind that the main parameters influencing cluster detectability are mass,\nextinction, and distance. Age also plays an important role, making older\nclusters harder to detect due to their fainter luminosity function. High proper\nmotions also improve detectability. After correcting for these selection\neffects, we find that old clusters are $2.97\\pm0.11$ times more common at a\nGalactocentric radius of 13~kpc than in the solar neighbourhood -- despite\npositive detection biases in their favour, such as hotter orbits or a higher\nscale height. The larger fraction of older clusters in the outer Galaxy cannot\nbe explained by an observational bias, and must be a physical property of the\nMilky Way: young outer-disc clusters are not forming in the outer Galaxy, or at\nleast not with sufficient masses to be identified as clusters in Gaia DR3. We\npredict that in this region, more old clusters than young ones remain to be\ndiscovered. The current presence of old, massive outer-disc clusters could be\nexplained by radial heating and migration, or alternatively by a lower cluster\ndestruction rate in the anticentre.\n",

The high-resolution\ndata allow for spectral deblending of the optical emission lines and reveal a\nbroad emission line component ($\\sigma_{\\rm{broad}} \\sim$~100--300 km s$^{-1}$)\nwith line ratios and kinematics consistent with a mixture of ionization by\nstars and radiative shocks.

The total kinetic power\nestimated from the cluster wind models matches the wind+SNe mechanical energy\ndeposition rate estimated from the soft band X-ray luminosity, indicating that\nat least 70\\% of the shock luminosity in the galaxy is driven by the star\nclusters. \\emph{Hubble Space Telescope} narrow band near-infrared imaging\nreveals embedded shocks in the dust-buried infrared nucleus of VV 114E. Most of\nthe shocked gas is blueshifted with respect to the quiescent medium, and there\nis a close spatial correspondence between the shock map and the \\emph{Chandra}\nsoft band X-ray image, implying the presence of a galactic superwind.
