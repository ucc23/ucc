      "title": "Angular-momentum pairs in spherical systems: applications to the\n  Galactic centre",
      "summary": "  Consider a system of point masses in a spherical potential. In such systems\nobjects execute planar orbits covering two-dimensional rings or annuli,\nrepresented by the angular-momentum vectors, which slowly reorient due to the\npersistent weak gravitational interaction between different rings. This\nprocess, called vector resonant relaxation, is much faster than other processes\nwhich change the size/shape of the rings. The interaction is stron9gest between\nobjects with closely aligned angular-momentum vectors. In this paper, we show\nthat nearly parallel angular-momentum vectors may form stable bound pairs in\nangular-momentum space. We examine the stability of such pairs against an\nexternal massive perturber, and determine the critical separation analogous to\nthe Hill radius or tidal radius in the three-body problem, where the\nangular-momentum pairs are marginally disrupted, as a function of the\nperturber's mass, the orbital inclination, and the radial distance.\nAngular-momentum pairs or multiples closer than the critical inclination will\nremain bound and evolve together in angular-momentum-direction space under any\nexternal influence, such as anisotropic density fluctuations, or massive\nperturbers. This study has applications in various astrophysical contexts,\nincluding galactic nuclei, in particular the Milky Way's Galactic centre,\nglobular clusters, or planetary systems. In nuclear star clusters with a\ncentral super-massive black hole, we apply this criterion to the disc of young,\nmassive stars, and show that clusters in angular-momentum space may be used to\nconstrain the presence of intermediate-mass black holes or the mass of the\nnearby gaseous torus.\n",

      "title": "Dynamical traction and black hole orbital migration",
      "summary": "  We investigate the circumstances which allow a black hole to remain put at\nthe galactic centre when the stellar core is anisotropic. We use N-body\ncalculations to study the response of stellar orbit families embedded in a\nlarger, isotropic isochrone (H\\'enon) background potential. When the BH orbits\nin an odd f[E,Lz] velocity distribution function, they transfer angular\nmomentum to it. We call this dynamical traction: it takes place whenever the\nkinetic energy drawn from f[E,Lz] has an excess of streaming motion over its\n(isotropic) v-dispersion. For a dynamically cold disc, the outcome depends on\nboth the orbit of the BH and that of a Jeans-unstable stellar sub-structures.\nWhen the stellar clumps have much binding energy, a BH may scatter off of them\nafter they formed. In the process the BH may be dislodged from the centre and\nmigrate outward due to dynamical traction. When the stellar clumps are less\nbound, they may still migrate to the centre where they either dissolve or merge\nwith the BH. The final configuration is similar to a nuclear star cluster which\nmay yet be moving at ~10 km/s wrt the barycentre.\n  The angular momentum transferred to a BH by dynamical traction delays the\nmigration to the galactic centre by several hundred million years. The\nefficiency of angular momentum transfer is a strong function of the fragmented\n(cold) state of the stellar space density. In a dynamically cold environment, a\nBH is removed from the central region through a two-stage orbital migration\ninstability. A criterion against this instability is proposed in the form of a\nthreshold in isotropic velocity dispersion compared to streaming motion. For a\nBH to settle at the heart of a galaxy on time-scales of ~ 300 Myr or less\nrequires that a large fraction of Lz be dissipated, or, alternatively, that the\nBH grows in situ in an isotropic environment devoid of sub-structures.\n",

      "summary": "  We present a detailed spectroscopic study of ionised gas in the nearby\n(~3.3Mpc) dwarf galaxy NGC 2366, a local analogue of Green Pea galaxies, based\non observations with the SCORPIO-2 instrument at the Russian 6-m BTA telescope.\nUsing scanning Fabry-Perot interferometry and long-slit spectroscopy, we\nexamine the gas kinematics, excitation mechanisms, and chemical abundances\nacross the disc of NGC 2366, including its prominent starburst region Mrk 71\nand the companion region NGC 2363. We identified 20 regions with locally\nelevated Ha velocity dispersion, only four of which correspond to known\nhigh-energy sources. We argue that one of the remaining objects can be a\npreviously unidentified Wolf-Rayet star and two - supernova remnants. For 15\nHII regions, we measure electron temperatures, oxygen and nitrogen abundances\nvia the `direct' Te method, with 12 + log(O/H) ranging from 7.6 to 8.0 in most\nof the regions. We show that Mrk 71 has higher oxygen abundance compared to the\nother \\HII regions in the galaxy, contrary to the previous indirect estimates\nsuggesting flat gradient throughout the galaxy. Together with the localized\nspatial variations of metallicity in the area, it is indicative of metal\nenrichment by the outflow from the super star cluster in the centre of Mrk 71.\n",

      "summary": "  We present Hubble Space Telescope far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectra of a\nblue-lurker$-$white-dwarf (BL-WD) binary system in the 4 Gyr open cluster M67.\nWe fit the FUV spectrum of the WD, determining it is a C/O WD with a mass of\n$0.72^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$ M$_\\odot$ and a cooling age of $\\sim400$ Myr. This\nrequires a WD progenitor of $\\sim3$ M$_\\odot$, significantly larger than the\ncurrent cluster turnoff mass of 1.3 M$_\\odot$. We suggest the WD progenitor\nstar formed several hundred Myr ago via the merger of two stars near the\nturnoff of the cluster. In this scenario, the original progenitor system was a\nhierarchical triple consisting of a close, near-equal-mass inner binary, with a\ntertiary companion with an orbit of a few thousand days. The WD is descended\nfrom the merged inner binary, and the original tertiary is now the observed BL.\nThe likely formation scenario involves a common envelope while the WD\nprogenitor is on the AGB, and thus the observed orbital period of 359 days\nrequires an efficient common envelope ejection. The rapid rotation of the BL\nindicates it accreted some material during its evolution, perhaps via a wind\nprior to the common envelope. This system will likely undergo a second common\nenvelope in the future, and thus could result in a short-period double WD\nbinary or merger of a 0.72 M$_\\odot$ C/O WD and a 0.38 $M_\\odot$ Helium WD,\nmaking this a potential progenitor of an interesting transient such as a\nsub-Chandrasekhar Type Ia supernova.\n",

      "summary": "  The Open Cluster Chemical Abundances and Mapping (OCCAM) survey seeks to\ncurate a large, comprehensive, uniform dataset of open clusters and member\nstars to constrain key Galactic parameters. This eighth entry from the OCCAM\nsurvey, based on the newly released SDSS-V/MWM Data Release 19 (DR19), has\nestablished a sample of 164 high quality open clusters that are used to\nconstrain the radial and azimuthal gradients of the Milky Way. The DR19 cluster\nsample [Fe/H] abundances are roughly consistent with measurements from other\nlarge-scale spectroscopic surveys. However, the gradients we calculate deviate\nconsiderably for some elements. We find an overall linear Galactic radial\n[Fe/H] gradient of $-0.075 \\pm 0.006$ dex kpc$^{-1}$ using the cluster's\ncurrent Galactocentric Radius ($R_{GC}$) and a gradient of $-0.068 \\pm 0.005$\ndex kpc$^-1$ with respect to the cluster's guiding center radius. We do not\nfind strong evidence for significant evolution of the differential element\ngradients ([X/Fe]) investigated here (O, Mg, Si, S, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni,\nNa, Al, K, Ce, Nd). For the first time using the OCCAM sample we have\nsufficient numbers of clusters to investigate Galactic azimuthal variations. In\nthis work, we do find evidence of azimuthal variations in the measured radial\nabundance gradient in the Galactic disk using our open cluster sample.\n",

      "title": "The Open Cluster Chemical Abundances and Mapping Survey: VIII. Galactic\n  Chemical Gradient and Azimuthal Analysis from SDSS/MWM DR19",
      "summary": "  The Open Cluster Chemical Abundances and Mapping (OCCAM) survey seeks to\ncurate a large, comprehensive, uniform dataset of open clusters and member\nstars to constrain key Galactic parameters. This eighth entry from the OCCAM\nsurvey, based on the newly released SDSS-V/MWM Data Release 19 (DR19), has\nestablished a sample of 164 high quality open clusters that are used to\nconstrain the radial and azimuthal gradients of the Milky Way. The DR19 cluster\nsample [Fe/H] abundances are roughly consistent with measurements from other\nlarge-scale spectroscopic surveys. However, the gradients we calculate deviate\nconsiderably for some elements. We find an overall linear Galactic radial\n[Fe/H] gradient of $-0.075 \\pm 0.006$ dex kpc$^{-1}$ using the cluster's\ncurrent Galactocentric Radius ($R_{GC}$) and a gradient of $-0.068 \\pm 0.005$\ndex kpc$^-1$ with respect to the cluster's guiding center radius. We do not\nfind strong evidence for significant evolution of the differential element\ngradients ([X/Fe]) investigated here (O, Mg, Si, S, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni,\nNa, Al, K, Ce, Nd). For the first time using the OCCAM sample we have\nsufficient numbers of clusters to investigate Galactic azimuthal variations. In\nthis work, we do find evidence of azimuthal variations in the measured radial\nabundance gradient in the Galactic disk using our open cluster sample.\n",

      "title": "Mass Distribution of Binary Black Hole Mergers from Young and Old Dense\n  Star Clusters",
      "summary": "  Dense star clusters are thought to contribute significantly to the merger\nrates of stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs) detected by the\nLIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. We combine $N$-body dynamic models of realistic\ndense star clusters with cluster formation histories to estimate the merger\nrate distribution as a function of primary mass for merging BBHs formed in\nthese environments. It has been argued that dense star clusters -- most notably\nold globular clusters -- predominantly produce BBH mergers with primary masses\n$M_p\\approx30\\,M_{\\odot}$. We show that dense star clusters forming at lower\nredshifts -- and thus having higher metallicities -- naturally produce\nlower-mass BBH mergers. We find that cluster BBH mergers span a wide range of\nprimary mass, from about $6\\,M_{\\odot}$ to above $100\\,M_{\\odot}$, with a peak\nnear $8\\,M_{\\odot}$, reproducing the overall merger rate distribution inferred\nfrom gravitational wave detections. Our results show that most low-mass BBH\nmergers (about $95\\%$ with $M_p\\lesssim 20\\,M_{\\odot}$) originate in metal-rich\n($Z \\sim Z_{\\odot}$) dense star clusters, while more massive BBH mergers form\npredominately in metal-poor globular clusters. We also discuss the role of\nhierarchical mergers in shaping the BBH mass distribution. Gravitational wave\ndetection of dynamically-formed low-mass BBH mergers -- potentially\nidentifiable by features such as isotropic spin distributions -- may serve as\nprobes of cluster formation histories in metal-rich environments at low\nredshifts.\n",
