      "title": "How Massive Star Clusters Form and Evolve: A Near-IR Survey of the W51\n  Complex",
      "summary": "  We present near-infrared JHKs and narrow-band H2(1-0) photometric\nobservations of the W51A region, obtained with GTC EMIR, aiming to characterize\nits young stellar population and provide mass estimates for individual cluster\nmembers and the proto-clusters. Our observations reveal over 3000 new sources,\nout of which 88 are located in the proto-clusters, W51 IRS2 and W51 Main. The\naverage extinction (AV), measured from the J-H color, of sources is 19 AV in\nW51 IRS2 and 14 AV in W51 Main. We document 17 new instances of H2 emission in\nthe region by utilizing observations from the H2(1-0) narrow-band filter.\nDespite limited completeness, we estimated masses for each cluster member and\nestimated the total cluster mass to be in the range of 900-4700 solar masses\nfor W51 IRS2 and 500-2700 solar masses for W51 Main, using an assumed age range\nof 1-3 Myr. We measured the initial mass function (IMF) in the proto-clusters\nassuming a range of ages from 1-3 Myr and found that the IMF slopes for both\nproto-clusters are consistent with the Salpeter IMF in the mass range greater\nthan or equal to 8 solar masses within 1 to 2 sigma.\n",

      "title": "Symbiotic stars in Galactic open clusters",
      "summary": "  The age determination of symbiotic stars is essential to put further\nconstraints on models explaining these binary systems. In the Galactic field,\nthis is especially problematic because of several limitations due to reddening\nestimations, for example. We searched for symbiotic stars as members of\nGalactic open clusters for which the age and overall metallicity can be\ndetermined in a statistical sense. The most recent lists of well-established\nand candidate symbiotic stars and open clusters were matched, and we found\nseven good candidates from which the well-established symbiotic star CQ Dra\nseems to be a true member of the old open cluster HSC 1224. The\ncolour-magnitude diagrams for the other candidates raise some doubts about\nmembership.\n",

      "title": "Ultraviolet photon production rates of the first stars: Impact on the He\n  II $λ$ 1640 Å emission line from primordial star clusters and the\n  21-cm signal from cosmic dawn",
      "summary": "  The first stars, the chemically pristine Population III, likely played an\nimportant role in heating the intergalactic medium during the epoch of cosmic\ndawn. The very high effective temperatures ($\\sim 10^5$ K) predicted for the\nmost massive Population III stars could also give rise to tell-tale signatures\nin the emission-line spectra of early star clusters or small galaxies dominated\nby such stars. Important quantities in modelling their observational signatures\ninclude their photon production rates at ultraviolet energies at which photons\nare able to ionize hydrogen and helium, dissociate molecular hydrogen and cause\nLyman-$\\alpha$ heating. Here, we model the spectral energy distributions of\nPopulation III stars to explore how these key quantities are affected by the\ninitial mass and rotation of Population III stars given a wide range of models\nfor the evolution of these stars. Our results indicate that rotating Population\nIII stars that evolve to effective temperatures $\\sim 2\\times 10^5$ K could\npotentially give rise to a very strong HeII 1640 emission line in the spectra\nfrom primordial star clusters, without requiring stellar masses of $\\gtrsim\n100\\ \\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ indicated by previous models for non-rotating Population\nIII stars. At the same time, the observable impact on 21-cm signatures from\ncosmic dawn and epoch of reionization from our set of rotating stars that\nevolve to $\\sim 2\\times 10^5$ K are modest, and produce potentially detectable\nfeatures in the global 21-cm signal and 21-cm power spectrum for high\nPopulation III star formation efficiencies only.\n",
