      "title": "Stellar distributions around supermassive black holes in gas-rich\n  nuclear star clusters",
      "summary": "  We study the stellar distribution around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in\ngas-rich nuclear star clusters (NSCs). NSCs could contain vast amounts of gas,\nwhich contribute significantly to shaping the stellar distribution, typically\naltering the stellar density cusp from the usual Bahcall \\& Wolf 1976 solution\nand consequently affecting the dynamics in the NSC. The dense gaseous\nenvironment in NSCs gives rise to dynamical phenomena that are otherwise rare\nin other gas-free environments. Here we extend the derivation introduced in\nBahcall \\& Wolf 1976 to include an additional energy dissipation term\nassociated with gas drag. We examine the effect of different forms of gas drag\non the stellar density distribution. Finally, we discuss implications on the\nrates of tidal disruption events and other transients triggered by stellar\ninteractions in gas-rich galactic nuclei.\n",

      "title": "Lonely Little Red Dots: Challenges to the AGN-nature of little red dots\n  through their clustering and spectral energy distributions",
      "summary": "  Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) reveal a previously\nunseen population of compact red objects, known as ``little red dots`` (LRDs).\nWe study a new photometrically selected sample of 124 LRDs in the redshift\nrange $z$ $\\sim$ 3 - 10 selected from NIRCam coverage of the CEERS, NEP-TDF,\nJADES and JEMS surveys. For JADES, the NEP-TDF and CEERS, we compare SED models\nwith and without AGN components and analyse the impact of an AGN component on\nthe goodness of fit using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). We find\nthat whilst the $\\chi^{2}$ of the majority of models containing AGN components\nis improved compared to models without AGN components, we show that the BIC\nsuggests models without AGN are a more appropriate fit to LRD SEDs, especially\nwhen MIRI data is available. We also measure LRD clustering in the CEERS field,\nJADES field, and NEP-TDF, where we compare the spatial distribution of LRDs and\ngalaxies with Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests of equality of distribution. We find\nthat the neighbourhood of LRDs tends to be less dense compared to galaxies at\nall selections and masses and at similar redshifts. We further measure upper\nlimit estimates for the halo masses of LRDs using abundance matching. Whilst\nthe population of LRDs could be a mixture of several different inherent\npopulations, as a whole it does appear that these systems are mostly hosting\ncompact galaxies or star clusters in formation.\n",

      "title": "Stability of a cluster-disrupted mean-motion resonance (chain) in HR\n  8799 and PDS 70",
      "summary": "  HR~8799 is a planetary system with four planets potentially in a mean-motion\nresonance chain. It is unclear from the observations if they are in mean-motion\nresonance. Similarly, PDS~70 has two observed planets also potentially in\nmean-motion resonance. We simulate HR~8799 and PDS~70 under external\nperturbations to study their responds if in resonance or mean-motion resonance.\nWe integrate the equations of motion for HR~8799 and PDS~70 starting with\neither in resonance or in mean-motion resonance and study their in isolation\nand in a star cluster. In the star cluster, we take the effects of passing\nstars into account. The dynamics of the star cluster is resolved using the\nLonely Planets module in AMUSE. HR~8799 and PDS~70 in mean-motion resonance are\nstable, whereas in non-resonance they dissolve in $0.303\\pm0.042$Myr and\n$1.26\\pm0.25$Myr, respectively. In a cluster, the non-resonant HR~8799 is\nslightly more stable than in isolation, but still dissolves in\n$0.300\\pm0.043$Myr, whereas the resonant planetary system remains stable for at\nleast $0.71$Myr. In contrast, a non-resonant PDS~70 system is approximately\nequally stable in a cluster compared to isolation, and dissolves in\n$1.03\\pm0.20$Myr, whereas the resonant PDS~70 system remains stable for at\nleast $0.83$Myr. Considering the more stable solutions of mean-motion resonance\nfor HR~8799, we argue that the planetary system was born in mean-motion\nresonance and that the mean-motion resonance was preserved. If HR~8799 was not\nborn in resonance, the probability that it survived until the present day is\nnegligible. Similarly, we argue that PDS~70 was probably born in mean-motion\nresonance and that its state was preserved. We also find that it is almost\npossible for planetary systems with a broken mean-motion resonance chain to\nsurvive longer in a perturbing cluster environment compared to isolation.\n",

      "title": "CLUES III: Do User Choices Impact The Results of SED Fitting? Tests of\n  'Off-The-Shelf' Stellar Population and Dust Extinction Models in the CLUES\n  Sample",
      "summary": "  The simple stellar population models produced by stellar population and\nspectral synthesis (SPS) codes are used as spectral templates in a variety of\nastrophysical contexts. In this paper, we test the predictions of four commonly\nused stellar population synthesis codes (YGGDRASIL, BPASS, FSPS, and a modified\nform of GALAXEV which we call GALAXEVneb) by using them as spectral templates\nfor photometric SED fitting with a sample of 18 young stellar clusters. All\nclusters have existing HST COS FUV spectroscopy that provide constraints on\ntheir ages as well as broadband photometry from HST ACS and WFC3. We use model\nspectra that account for both nebular and stellar emission, and additionally\ntest four extinction curves at different values of $R_V$. We find that for\nindividual clusters, choice of extinction curve and SPS model can introduce\nsignificant scatter into the results of SED fitting. Model choice can introduce\nscatter of 34.8 Myr in age, a factor of 9.5 in mass, and 0.40mag in extinction.\nExtinction curve choice can introduce scatter of up to a factor of 32.3 Myr in\nage, a factor of 10.4 in mass, and 0.41mag in extinction. We caution that\nbecause of this scatter, one-to-one comparisons between the properties of\nindividual objects derived using different SED fitting setups may not be\nmeaningful. However, our results also suggest that SPS model and extinction\ncurve choice do not introduce major systematic differences into SED fitting\nresults when the entire cluster population is considered. The distribution of\ncluster properties for a large enough sample is relatively robust to user\nchoice of SPS code and extinction curve.\n",

A clear\nturn-off point at $\\sim$1.7 M$_\\odot$ in the mass function suggests the escape\nof low-mass stars, and the lower photometric mass compared to the dynamical\nmass indicates ongoing disruption due to external forces. Our long-baseline\noptical photometric data also identifies 64 periodic and 16 non-periodic stars\nin this region. We have presented the light curves and the classification of\nthose variables. The periodic stars have periods ranging from $\\sim$0.05 days\nto $\\sim$3.00 days and amplitude ranges from $\\sim$8 mmag to $\\sim$700 mmag.\nThe nonperiodic stars show variation from $\\sim$30 mmag to $\\sim$500 mmag. The\nperiodic stars include main-sequence pulsating variables such as Slow Pulsating\nB-type, $\\delta$ Scuti, RR Lyrae, and $\\gamma$ Doradus.

      "title": "Very-wide-orbit planets from dynamical instabilities during the stellar\n  birth cluster phase",
      "summary": "  Gas giant planets have been detected on eccentric orbits several hundreds of\nastronomical units in size around other stars. It has been proposed that even\nthe Sun hosts a wide-orbit planet of 5-10 Earth masses, often called Planet\nNine, which influences the dynamics of distant Trans-Neptunian objects.\nHowever, the formation mechanism of such planets remains uncertain. Here we use\nnumerical simulations to show that very wide-orbit planets are a natural\nbyproduct of dynamical instabilities that occur in planetary systems while\ntheir host stars are still embedded in natal stellar clusters. A planet is\nfirst brought to an eccentric orbit with an apoastron of several hundred au by\nrepeated gravitational scattering by other planets, then perturbations from\nnearby stellar flybys stabilise the orbit by decoupling the planet from the\ninteraction with the inner system. In our Solar System, the two main events\nlikely conducive to planetary scattering were the growth of Uranus and Neptune,\nand the giant planets instability. We estimate a 5-10% likelihood of creating a\nvery wide-orbit planet if either happened while the Sun was still in its birth\ncluster, rising to 40% if both were. In our simulated exoplanetary systems, the\ntrapping efficiency is 1-5\\%. Our results imply that planets on wide, eccentric\norbits occur at least $10^{-3}$ per star.\n",

      "title": "Gas meets Kozai: the influence of a gas-rich accretion disc on\n  hierarchical triples undergoing von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai oscillations",
      "summary": "  Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) consist of a central supermassive black hole\n(SMBH) embedded in a region with both high gas and stellar densities: the gas\nis present as a thin accretion disc that fuels the central SMBH, while the\nstars form a dense, roughly isotropic nuclear star cluster. The binaries\npresent in such a cluster could be considered naturally as triples, with the\nSMBH as a third object, and their dynamics also depend on the interaction with\nthe gas-rich disc. In this paper, we study the evolution of such a binary on an\ninclined orbit with respect to the disc. The binary experiences both\neccentricity excitation via the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) effect and drag\nforces from each time it penetrates the disc. We find that, as the outer\norbital inclination decreases, the evolution of inner orbital separation can\ntransition from a regime of gradual hardening to a regime of rapid softening.\nAs such binaries grow wider, their minimum pericentre distances (during ZLK\noscillations) decrease. We show that a simple geometric condition, modulated by\nthe complex ZLK evolution, dictates whether a binary expands or contracts due\nto the interactions with the AGN disc. Our results suggest that the interaction\nwith gas-rich accretion disc could enhance the rate of stellar mergers and\nformation of gravitational wave sources, as well as other transients. The\ntreatment introduced here is general and could apply, with the proper\nmodifications, to hierarchical triples in other gas-rich systems.\n",

      "title": "Hydrodynamic simulations of black hole evolution in AGN discs I: orbital\n  alignment of highly inclined satellites",
      "summary": "  The frequency of compact object interactions in AGN discs is naturally tied\nto the number of objects embedded within it. We investigate the evolution of\nblack holes in the nuclear stellar cluster on inclined orbits to the AGN disc\nby performing adiabatic hydrodynamical simulations of isolated black hole disc\ncrossings over a range of disc densities and inclinations\n$i\\in[2^\\circ,15^\\circ]$. We find radiation dominates the pressure in the wake\nthat forms around the BH across the full inclination and disc density range. We\nidentify no well defined steady state wake morphology due to the thin geometry\nof the disc and the vertical exponential density drop off, where the wake\nmorphology depends on the vertical depth of the transit within the disc. The\ninclination damping $\\Delta i$ relative the pre-transit inclination behaves as\na power law in $\\sin(i)$ and the ambient Hill mass $m_\\text{H,0}$ as $\\Delta\ni/i \\propto m_{\\rm H,0}^{0.4} \\sin(i)^{-2.7}$. The drag on the BH is dominated\nby the gravity of the wake for the majority of our inclination range until\naccretion effects become comparable at $\\sin(i)\\gtrsim30H_0/R_0$, where\n$H_0/R_0$ is the disc aspect ratio. At low inclinations\n($\\sin(i)\\lesssim3H_0/R_0$) the wake morphology becomes more spherical, leading\nto a regime change in the inclination damping behaviour. Our results suggest\nthat the inclination damping timescale is shorter than expected from only\nepisodic Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttelton accretion events during each transit, implying\ninclined objects may captured by the AGN disc earlier in its lifetime than\npreviously thought.\n",
