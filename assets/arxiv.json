      "title": "Using gravitational waves and multi-messenger Astronomy to\n  reverse-engineer the properties of galactic nuclei",
      "summary": "  Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are powered by accretion disks onto supermassive\nblack holes in the the centers of galaxies. AGN are believed to play important\nroles in the evolution of both supermassive black holes and their host galaxies\nover cosmic time. AGN and the nuclear star clusters (NSCs) that interact with\nthem remain unresolved with present and planned telescopes. As a result, the\nproperties of AGN and NSCs are highly uncertain. Here we review how binary\nblack hole (BBH) mergers can occur in AGN disks and how both the gravitational\nwave (GW) and electromagnetic wave (EM) properties of such mergers allow us to\nreverse-engineer the properties of AGN disks and NSCs over cosmic time. We\npoint out that the feature in the BBH mass spectrum around $\\sim 35M_{\\odot}$\nis an excellent probe of hierarchical merger models. Likewise constraints on\nthe spins of upper-mass gap BH ($\\gtrsim 50M_{\\odot}$) test the AGN channel.\nThe effective spin ($\\chi_{\\rm eff}$) distribution, including asymmetry,\nislands of structure and magnitudes are excellent tests of AGN model\npredictions. We also argue, that the rate of AGN-driven BBH mergers as a\nfunction of redshift should scale slightly shallower than the AGN number\ndensity, at least out to redshifts of $\\sim 2$, and should turnover at the same\nredshift as the AGN number density. Finally, we emphasize a determination of an\nAGN fraction of observed BBH mergers ($f_{\\rm BBH,AGN}$), \\emph{regardless of\nthe actual value}, allows us to infer the average properties of AGN disks and\nNSCs out to high redshift.\n",

      "title": "Deriving physical parameters of unresolved star clusters. VIII. Limits\n  of aperture photometry for star cluster studies",
      "summary": "  Recently, it has been noticed that the discrepancies in the integrated colour\nindices (CIs) between star clusters and models are mostly due to the projection\nof bright stars in the apertures. In order to reduce this problem, the method\nof adaptive aperture photometry has been proposed. This method has been applied\nto star clusters from the M 31 Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT)\nsurvey, and studies show that the adaptive aperture photometry performs better\nthan the conventional approach. The aim of this study is to determine the best\nachievable limits on the accuracy and applicability of the aperture photometry\nmethod for studying star clusters in the local Universe. We computed a large\nnetwork of artificial 3D star clusters spanning the parameter space of the M 31\nclusters. We then simulated images of these clusters by projecting each onto a\n2D plane from 100 directions. Star cluster images were generated in six\npassbands to match the PHAT survey. To investigate the limiting accuracy of\naperture photometry and the limits of its applicability to star cluster\nstudies, we measured the simulated images and performed parameter determination\ntests. We demonstrate that star clusters with and without post-main-sequence\nstars have significant photometric differences. We show that in order to obtain\nreliable physical parameters of star clusters, the CIs must be measured using\nan aperture with a radius larger than the cluster's half-light radius.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that the parameter determination of young clusters\n(~10 Myr) is problematic regardless of the aperture size used. Therefore, it is\nadvisable to determine the parameters of these clusters using colour-magnitude\ndiagram fitting methods, when possible. We also show that the randomness of the\nviewing angle can lead to a CI uncertainty of up to 0.1 mag, depending on\ncluster parameters and aperture size.\n",

      "title": "Chandra X-ray Measurement of Heavy Element Abundances of Wolf-Rayet\n  Stars in the Galactic Center",
      "summary": "  Elemental abundances hold important information about the star formation\nhistory in the Galactic Center. The thermal X-ray spectra of certain stars can\nprovide a robust probe of elemental abundances, mainly through the presence of\nK-shell emission lines. In this work, based on deep archival {\\it Chandra}\nobservations, we obtain X-ray measurements of five heavy elements (Si, S, Ar,\nCa and Fe) for three sources in the Arches cluster, one source in the\nQuintuplet cluster, as well as a field source known as Edd 1, which are all\nprobable WR stars exhibiting a high quality X-ray spectrum. A two-temperature,\nnon-equilibrium ionization plasma model is employed for the spectral fit,\ntaking into account light element compositions characteristic of WR star winds,\nwhich is substantially depleted in hydrogen but enriched in nitrogen and/or\ncarbon. It is found that the Arches and Quintuplet WR stars share similar\nabundances of Si, S, and Ar, while exhibiting distinct Ca and Fe abundances,\nwhich may be understood as due to dust depletion of the latter two elements in\nQuintuplet. The observed near-solar or sub-solar metallicity of the WR star\nwinds can be naturally understood as the result of nucleosynthesis and internal\nmixing of the parent star, which have a supersolar initial metallicity as\nexpected for the Galactic center in general. Implications of our findings on\nthe origin of the young star clusters and isolated massive stars in the\nGalactic center, as well as the elemental composition of the accretion flow\nonto Sgr A*, are addressed.\n",

      "summary": "  We present a study of the double-lined spectroscopic binary HD 21278 that\ncontains one of the brightest main sequence stars in the young $\\alpha$ Persei\nopen cluster. We analyzed new spectra and reanalyzed archived spectra to\nmeasure precise new radial velocity curves for the binary. We also obtained\ninterferometric data using the CHARA Array at Mount Wilson to measure the sky\npositions of the two stars and the inclination of the $\\sim$ 2 milliarcsecond\norbit. We determine that the two stars have masses of $5.381 \\pm 0.084\nM_{\\odot}$ and $3.353 \\pm 0.064 M_{\\odot}$. From isochrone fits, we find the\ncluster's age to be $49 \\pm 7$ Myr (using PARSEC models) or $49.5 \\pm 6$ Myr\n(MIST models). Finally, we revisit the massive white dwarfs that are candidate\nescapees from the $\\alpha$ Persei cluster to try to better characterize the\nmassive end of the white dwarf initial-final mass relation. The implied\nprogenitor masses challenge the idea that Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs are\nmade by single stars with masses near $8 \\msun$.\n",

      "summary": "  Leveraging spectroscopic data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we conduct a\ncomprehensive analysis of the central stellar velocity dispersion, stellar\npopulation properties, star formation history, and gas-phase chemical\nabundances in AGC721966, a unique ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG) harboring a\npseudobulge. Our findings reveal that the pseudobulge formed in the early\nuniverse but underwent a recent episode of rejuvenated star formation. The\nsystem exhibits a mass-weighted (light-weighted) stellar population age of\n$\\tau_{\\star}\\sim 7.4\\pm2.5$ ($2.9\\pm1.5$)~Gyr, a stellar metallicity of\n[M/H]$\\sim -0.62\\pm0.26$ ($-0.55\\pm0.20$), an $\\alpha$-element enhancement of\n[$\\alpha$/Fe]$\\sim 0.36\\pm0.09$ ($0.37\\pm0.07$), and a gas-phase oxygen\nabundance of \\Oabund$\\sim 8.15\\pm0.03$. The central stellar velocity dispersion\nis measured as $\\sigma_{\\rm c}\\sim 57.9\\pm15.7$~km/s. These results provide\nrobust evidence supporting the early halo-halo merging formation scenario\nproposed by \\cite{Rong25}, while unequivocally ruling out the ``failed''\n$L^{\\star}$ formation model, at least for AGC721966. Furthermore, through\nsystematic application of the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, we establish that\nthese pseudobulge-hosting UDGs are neither misidentified nuclear star\ncluster-bearing dwarf galaxies nor bulge-dominated massive galaxies, thereby\naffirming their distinct evolutionary pathway.\n",

      "summary": "  The inner ~200 pc region of the Milky Way contains a nuclear stellar disc and\na nuclear star cluster that are embedded in the larger Galactic bar. These\nstellar systems overlap spatially, which makes it challenging to separate stars\nthat belong to the nuclear stellar systems, to deduce their internal dynamics,\nand to derive the central Galactic potential. Discrete stellar kinematics probe\nthe mass distribution of a stellar system, and chemical tracers such as stellar\nmetallicity can further separate multiple stellar populations that can have\ndistinct kinematic properties. We took advantage of the information provided by\ndiscrete stellar kinematics and the metallicity in the Galactic centre using\ndiscrete chemo-dynamical modelling. We fitted axisymmetric Jeans models to\ndiscrete data of 4,600 stars. We fitted the stars as either one population plus\na background component or as two populations plus a background that represents\nthe bar. We tested the robustness of the inferred gravitational potential\nagainst a varying mass of the supermassive black hole, including dark matter,\nor a radially varying mass-to-light ratio. We obtained robust results on the\nfit with a single population and a background component. We obtained a\nsupermassive black hole mass of (4.35$\\pm 0.24) \\times 10^6$ M$_\\odot$, and we\nfind that a dark matter component and radial variation in the mass-to-light\nratio are negligible. We derived the enclosed mass profile of the inner ~60 pc\nand found a lower mass than reported in the literature in the region of ~5-30\npc. In our two-population fit, we found a high-[M/H] population that\ncontributes more than 90% to the total stellar density. The properties of the\nhigh-[M/H] population are consistent with in situ formation after gas inflow\nfrom the Galactic disc via the bar. The distinct kinematic properties of the\nlow-[M/H] population indicate a different origin. [abridged]\n",

      "title": "Wind-fed Supermassive Black Hole Accretion by the Nuclear Star Cluster:\n  the Case of M31*",
      "summary": "  The central supermassive black hole (SMBH) of the Andromeda galaxy, known as\nM31*, exhibits dim electromagnetic emission and is inferred to have an\nextremely low accretion rate for its remarkable mass ($\\sim10^8~\\rm~M_\\odot$).\nIn this work, we use three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations to explore a\npreviously untested scenario, in which M31* is fed by the collective stellar\nmass-loss from its surrounding nuclear star cluster, manifested as a famous\neccentric disk of predominantly old stellar populations. The stellar mass-loss\nis assumed to be dominated by the slow and cold winds from 100 asymptotic\ngiant-branch stars, which follow well-constrained Keplerian orbits around M31*\nand together provide a mass injection rate of\n$\\sim4\\times10^{-5}\\rm~M_\\odot~yr^{-1}$. The simulations achieve a quasi-steady\nstate on a Myr timescale, at which point a quasi-Keplerian, cool\n($T\\sim10^3-10^4~\\rm K$) gas disk extending several parsecs is established.\nThis disk is continuously supplied by the stellar winds and itself feeds the\ncentral SMBH. At the end of the simulations at 2 Myr, an accretion rate of\n$\\sim2\\times10^{-5}\\rm~M_\\odot~yr^{-1}$ is found but could vary by a factor of\nfew depending on whether the subdominant gravity of the NSC or a moderate\nglobal inflow is included. The predicted X-ray luminosity of $\\sim10^{36}~\\rm\nerg~s^{-1}$, dominated by the hot ($T\\sim10^7-10^8~\\rm K$) plasma within 0.2\nparsec of the SMBH, is well consistent with Chandra observations. We conclude\nthat the feeding mechanism of M31* is successfully identified, which has\nimportant implications for the working of dormant SMBHs prevalent in the local\nuniverse.\n",

      "summary": "  As thousands of new open clusters in the Galaxy have recently been reported\nwith reddening or extinction information, we map the distribution and\nproperties of the Galaxy's interstellar material in the Galactic disk as traced\nby these open clusters. By analyzing the distribution of interstellar\nextinction for 6215 open clusters located at low Galactic latitude b <= 6 deg,\ncorresponding to the thin Galactic disk, we identify a reddening plane\ncharacterized by a dust layer whose thickness varies with Galactic longitude.\nBy splitting the open clusters sample into several sub-regions of Galactic\nlongitude, we observe that the reddening plane is not perfectly aligned with\nthe formal Galactic plane, but instead varies sinusoidally around the Galactic\nmid-plane. The maximum and minimum interstellar absorption occur at\napproximately 42 deg and 222 deg, respectively, along the Galactic longitude.\nOur analysis reveals a noticeable north-south asymmetry in the distribution of\ninterstellar absorption, with a higher proportion of interstellar material\nbelow the Galactic plane. We also find that the Sun is located 15.7 +/- 7.3 pc\nabove the reddening plane. The scale height of the open clusters from the\nreddening plane is estimated to be z_h = 87.3 +/- 1.8 pc. The mean thickness of\nthe absorbing material in the reddening plane, which represents the average\nextent of the dust layer responsible for interstellar extinction, is found to\nbe about 201 +/- 20 pc. Our findings provide insights into the distribution of\ninterstellar dust, its relationship with the Galactic thin disk, and its\nimplications for the Galactic structure.\n",

      "summary": "  Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) reveal a previously\nunseen population of compact red objects, known as ``little red dots`` (LRDs).\nWe study a new photometrically selected sample of 124 LRDs in the redshift\nrange $z$ $\\sim$ 3 - 10 selected from NIRCam coverage of the CEERS, NEP-TDF,\nJADES and JEMS surveys. For JADES, the NEP-TDF and CEERS, we compare SED models\nwith and without AGN components and analyse the impact of an AGN component on\nthe goodness of fit using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). We find\nthat whilst the $\\chi^{2}$ of the majority of models containing AGN components\nis improved compared to models without AGN components, we show that the BIC\nsuggests models without AGN are a more appropriate fit to LRD SEDs, especially\nwhen MIRI data is available. We also measure LRD clustering in the CEERS field,\nJADES field, and NEP-TDF, where we compare the spatial distribution of LRDs and\ngalaxies with Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests of equality of distribution. We find\nthat the neighbourhood of LRDs tends to be less dense compared to galaxies at\nall selections and masses and at similar redshifts. We further measure upper\nlimit estimates for the halo masses of LRDs using abundance matching. Whilst\nthe population of LRDs could be a mixture of several different inherent\npopulations, as a whole it does appear that these systems are mostly hosting\ncompact galaxies or star clusters in formation.\n",
