      "title": "Shockingly Effective: Cluster Winds as Engines of Feedback in Starburst\n  Galaxy VV 114",
      "summary": "  We present high-resolution Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) and MUSE IFU\nspectroscopy of VV 114, a local infrared-luminous merger undergoing a vigorous\nstarburst and showing evidence of galactic-scale feedback. The high-resolution\ndata allow for spectral deblending of the optical emission lines and reveal a\nbroad emission line component ($\\sigma_{\\rm{broad}} \\sim$~100--300 km s$^{-1}$)\nwith line ratios and kinematics consistent with a mixture of ionization by\nstars and radiative shocks. The shock fraction (percent ionization due to\nshocks) in the high velocity gas is anticorrelated with projected surface\nnumber density of resolved star clusters, and we find radial density profiles\naround clusters are well fit by models of adiabatically expanding cluster winds\ndriven by massive stellar winds and supernovae (SNe). The total kinetic power\nestimated from the cluster wind models matches the wind+SNe mechanical energy\ndeposition rate estimated from the soft band X-ray luminosity, indicating that\nat least 70\\% of the shock luminosity in the galaxy is driven by the star\nclusters. \\emph{Hubble Space Telescope} narrow band near-infrared imaging\nreveals embedded shocks in the dust-buried infrared nucleus of VV 114E. Most of\nthe shocked gas is blueshifted with respect to the quiescent medium, and there\nis a close spatial correspondence between the shock map and the \\emph{Chandra}\nsoft band X-ray image, implying the presence of a galactic superwind. The\nenergy budget of the superwind is in close agreement with the total kinetic\npower of the cluster winds, confirming the superwind is driven by the\nstarburst.\n",

      "title": "Structure and Magnetic Field of Bright-rimmed Cloud IC 1396E/SFO 38",
      "summary": "  We carried out polarimetric observations of the bright-rimmed cloud IC\n1396E/SFO 38 with SCUBA-2/POL-2 to study the effect of ultraviolet (UV) light\non its structure and magnetic field. This bright-rimmed cloud appears optically\nto be one single cloud illuminated by the UV light from the excited star of IC\n1396, however our Stokes I image and 13CO(J=3-2) archival data suggest that\nthis cloud is not a simple, single structure, but appears to be composed of two\nparts on first glance; a head part with wings and a tail, and a north-west\nextension part.Since molecular clouds are generally filamentary and it seems\nlikely that the initial structures of bright-rimmed clouds are expected to be\nalso generally elongated, we examined the possibility that the structure was\ncreated from a single elongated cloud by the UV impact. We compared the cloud\nstructure with a simulation study that investigated the evolution of prolate\nclouds exposed to the UV radiation from various directions and found that this\napparent two-part structure could be reproduced in a situation where a single\nfilamentary cloud is obliquely illuminated by UV light. The magnetic field\ndirections of the cloud are different from the ambient field direction,\ndemonstrating the field reconfiguration due to the UV impact. The distortion or\npinch of the magnetic field is seen toward the cloud head, where an\nintermediate-mass star cluster is located, suggesting gravitational\ncontraction. We roughly estimated the magnetic strength and stability in three\nparts of the cloud and found that the cloud head is most likely to be\nsupercritical.\n",
