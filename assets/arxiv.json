      "title": "A hidden link in the LMC star cluster formation history",
      "summary": "  The age distribution function of star clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud\n(LMC) is known to present a feature called the cluster age gap, a period of\ntime from ~ 4 to 11 Gyr ago with a remarkable small number of clusters\nidentified. In this work we performed an in-depth analysis of three recently\ncatalogued age gap cluster candidates with the aim of confirming their physical\nnature. We used GEMINI@GMOS g,i photometry centred on the objects to build\ncolour-magnitude diagrams from which we recognised their main features. We also\nperformed an automatic search of stellar overdensities using Gaussian mixture\nmodel techniques and analysed the corresponding colour-magnitude diagrams\nsimilarly as performed for the aforementioned candidates. The present GEMINI\ndata sets would seem to discard any strong evidence of these object being real\nclusters, and rather support the possibility of the result of stellar density\nvariations of the LMC field star distribution. These three objects, in addition\nto other 17 new identified candidates, are placed in the LMC outermost disc in\na limited region toward the southwest from the LMC centre. They had embraced\nthe possibility to answer the long-time conundrum about the absence of LMC age\ngap clusters. From an statistical approach, combined with the knowledge of the\nexpected LMC age-metallicity relationship, and recent simulations of the\ninteraction between the LMC and the Milky Way, we provide not only evidence\nagainst the physical nature of the studied objects, but also an interpretation\non the lack of identification of more LMC age gap clusters.\n",

      "title": "A generalized semi-analytic model for the combined outflow from a\n  cluster of stars with strong stellar winds",
      "summary": "  We derive semi-analytic solutions for the thermally driven cumulative outflow\nfrom a dense stellar cluster that consists of a large number of stars with\nstrong stellar winds, under the key assumption that their mass and energy\ndeposition can be treated as a continuous source of thermalized wind material.\nOur approach provides explicit analytic forms for the flow critical radius and\nsound speed, which then allows for full solution by inward/outward integration\nfrom this critical radius. Application to previous models that assume either a\npower-law or exponential mass deposition allows a direct comparison of their\nvelocity solutions. We then obtain solutions for new models that have mass\ndepositions with a gaussian or the empirically motivated forms derived by\nPlummer and Elson. Comparisons show that, when cast in terms of the radius\nscaled by the critical radius, the overall velocity laws are all quite similar,\nasymptotically approaching the energy-averaged stellar wind speed $V_w$, and\nanchored to passing through a common critical/sonic speed $v_c = V_w/2$. By\nderiving associated variations in outflow density and temperature, we obtain\nscaling forms for the expected X-ray emission, and show that radiative cooling\ngenerally represents only a small correction to the assumed cooling from\nadiabatic expansion. An initial analysis of incomplete wind thermalization\nsuggests this should likewise have modest effect on the overall outflow in\ndense clusters. The simplified semi-analytic method presented here can be\nreadily applied to alternative mass depositions and so form a basis for\ninterpreting results from detailed numerical simulations of outflows from young\nstellar clusters.\n",

      "title": "JWST Spectroscopic Confirmation of the Cosmic Gems Arc at z=9.625 --\n  Insights into the small scale structure of a post-burst system",
      "summary": "  We present JWST/NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy of the Cosmic Gems arc,\nstrongly magnified by the galaxy cluster SPT-CL J0615$-$5746. Six-hour\nintegration using NIRSpec prism spectroscopy (resolution $\\rm R\\simeq 30-300$),\ncovering the spectral range $0.8-5.3~\\mu m$, reveals a pronounced $\\rm\nLy\\alpha$-continuum break at $\\lambda \\simeq 1.3~\\mu m$, and weak optical $\\rm\nH\\beta$ and $\\rm [OIII]\\lambda4959$ emission lines at $z=9.625\\pm0.002$,\nlocated in the reddest part of the spectrum ($\\lambda > 5.1~\\mu m$). No\nadditional ultraviolet or optical emission lines are reliably detected. A weak\nBalmer break is measured alongside a very blue ultraviolet slope ($\\beta\n\\leq-2.5$, $\\rm F_{\\lambda} \\sim \\lambda^{\\beta}$). Spectral fitting with $\\tt\nBagpipes$ suggests the Cosmic Gems galaxy is in a post-starburst phase, making\nit the highest-redshift system currently observed in a mini-quenched state.\nSpatially resolved spectroscopy at tens pc scales shows relatively uniform\nfeatures across subcomponents of the arc. These findings align well with\nphysical properties previously derived from JWST/NIRCam photometry of the\nstellar clusters, now corroborated by spectroscopic evidence. In particular,\nfive observed star clusters exhibit ages of $\\rm 7-30~Myr$. An updated lens\nmodel constrains the intrinsic sizes and masses of these clusters, confirming\nthey are extremely compact and denser than typical star clusters in local\nstar-forming galaxies. Additionally, four compact stellar systems consistent\nwith star clusters ($\\lesssim10$ pc) are identified along the extended tail of\nthe arc. A sub-parsec line-emitting HII region straddling the critical line,\nlacking a NIRCam counterpart, is also serendipitously detected.\n",

      "title": "The z = 9.625 Cosmic Gems Galaxy was a \"Compact Blue Monster\" Propelled\n  by Massive Star Clusters",
      "summary": "  The recent discovery of five massive stellar clusters at z=9.625 in the\nCosmic Gems has raised the question about the formation mechanism of star\nclusters in the first half Gyr after the Big-Bang. We infer the total stellar\nmass in clusters by normalizing and integrating the stellar cluster mass\nfunction (SCMF, dn(M)/dM ~ (n$_0$) $M^\\beta$), assuming three different slopes\n$\\beta$ = -1.5, -2.0 and -2.5 and different lower-mass limits between $10^2$\nand $10^5$ Msun. The total integrated cluster stellar mass is compared to the\nstellar mass inferred from the counter-image of the Cosmic Gems, which provides\nthe best, modestly magnified ($\\mu$ = 1.84$\\pm$0.05) representation of the\nentire galaxy. The delensed stellar mass of the Cosmic Gems galaxy is estimated\nas 3.5$_{-1.8}^{+3.3}$ x$10^7$ Msun, with an effective radius of Reff =\n103$_{-15}^{+13}$ parsec and a stellar surface mass density of $\\Sigma$mass =\n520$_{-225}^{+340}$ Msun pc$^{-2}$. Accounting for normalization uncertainties\n- including different lensing magnification scenarios for the arc - a modified\nSCMF, combined with a significantly high star cluster formation efficiency\n(approaching 100%), appears to be a necessary condition to explain the\nrelatively short formation timescale of both the star clusters and the\ncounter-image, without exceeding the galaxy's stellar mass. By extrapolating\nthe physical properties at the peak of the burst we find that in its recent\npast (<~ 30 Myr) the Cosmic Gems galaxy has likely experienced a specific star\nformation rate (sSFR) exceeding 25 Gyr$^{-1}$ and luminosity approaching the\n``blue monster'' regime (M$_{UV}$ < -20). Our study provides insights into the\nextreme clustered nature of star formation in early galaxies and shed light\ninto the formation of bound star clusters that might survive to z = 0 as\nglobular clusters, older than 13 Gyr.\n",

      "summary": "  We present compelling observational evidence supporting G178.28-00.61 as an\nearly-stage candidate for Cloud-Cloud Collision (CCC), with indications of the\nformation of an S-shaped filament, evenly-separated dense cores, and young star\nclusters. The observations of CO molecular line emission demonstrate the\nexistence of two interacting molecular clouds with systemic velocities of 0.8\nkm/s and -1.2 km/s, respectively. The convergence zone of these two clouds\nreveals an S-shaped filament in the JCMT 850 micron continuum image, suggesting\ncloud interaction. In line with expectations from CCC simulations, broad\nbridging features are discernible in the position-velocity diagrams. An\nelevated concentration of identified Class I and II young stellar objects along\nthe filament at the intersection area further supports the hypothesis of a\ncollision-induced origin. This observation could be explained by a recent MHD\nmodel of CCC (Kong et al. 2024), which predicts a similar morphology, scale,\ndensity, and unbound status, as well as the orientation of the polarization.\n",

      "summary": "  The chemical evolution history of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) is complex\nand is best understood through a comprehensive analysis of star clusters across\nits various regions. The VISCACHA survey aims to fully explain the chemical\nevolution of SMC star clusters by analyzing different sub-regions adopted from\nan existing framework. The west halo (WH) region, which contains the oldest and\nmost metal-poor stellar populations, exhibits a clear age-metallicity relation\n(AMR) with minimal dispersion. This region shows a significant dip of ~0.5 dex\nin metallicity approximately 6 Gyr ago. This was likely caused by a major\nmerger event that subsequently accelerated the star formation rate. Clusters in\nthe Southern Bridge (SB) and Northern Bridge regions of the SMC may have\nexperienced distinct chemical enrichment histories, as suggested by our\nprevious works but with limited data coverage. Furthermore, the AMR of\nwing/bridge (W/B) shows no sign of enrichment caused by the aforementioned\nmerger event, but exhibits signatures of the recent collisions between the\nclouds contemporaneous with the epochs of the Magellanic Stream and Bridge\nformations.\n  In this study, we present an updated AMR for the SB region based on a sample\nthat includes approximately 67% of its known clusters. Contrary to the\nexpectation of a very unique chemical evolution history, these SB clusters show\na trend similar to the one of the WH clusters. The chemical evolution models\nthat best fit the AMR trend of the SB clusters show excellent agreement with\nthe major merger model proposed for the WH clusters. Building on this, we\nsuggest a new unified chemical evolution model for both the WH and SB clusters,\nwhich can be explained by a major merger at ~6 Gyr followed by episodic\nchemical enrichment over time.\n",

      "title": "Resolving Black Hole Family Issues Among the Massive Ancestors of Very\n  High-Spin Gravitational-Wave Events Like GW231123",
      "summary": "  The latest detection of GW231123, a binary black hole (BH) merger with\nexceptionally large masses and high spins for the incoming components, has been\nsuggested as a smoking gun for hierarchical formation. In this scenario, a\nfirst generation of BHs resulting from collapsing stars form in a dense\nenvironment. Here they can assemble dynamically and undergo subsequent mergers.\nWe discuss three challenges for the formation of a GW231123-like event inside a\nstar cluster: 1) The high masses of the incoming BHs appear to be in the\npredicted pair-instability mass gap and thus suggest that second-generation or\nhigher-order generation BHs are involved. 2) Very high spins ($\\chi_f \\gtrsim\n0.8$) are very unlikely for dynamically assembled BHs because of the isotropic\ndistribution of spin vectors. 3) Hierarchically formed BHs are susceptible to\nreceive large recoils, which could kick them out of their cluster. We simulate\nthis scenario and show that only a few percent of mergers recover remnants\nwithin GW231123's primary spin estimate $\\chi_1=0.9^{+0.10}_{-0.19}$ and are\nretained inside typical star clusters. A large fraction of very rapidly\nspinning second-generation BHs (including $\\chi_f>0.9$) can only form if the\nfirst-generation BHs merges with aligned spins. This is a natural outcome of\nmassive binary star evolution scenarios, such as a chemically homogeneous\nevolution. This scenario also predicts equal masses for the components,\nimplying that the resulting BHs tend to receive very low recoil kicks and would\ntherefore likely be retained inside a cluster. We conclude that GW231123-like\nevents, if formed in a star cluster, could require first-generation BHs with\nlarge aligned spins that evolved through stellar binary interaction, followed\nby the dynamical assembly for a subsequent merger. We discuss the implications\nfor the uncertain lower edge of the putative mass gap 60-130 $\\rm M_\\odot$.\n",

      "summary": "  The extended main-sequence turn-off (eMSTO) is a well-known feature observed\nin young and intermediate-age star clusters, characterized by a significant\nbroadening of the main-sequence turn-off region. Although prolonged star\nformation and stellar rotation have been proposed as possible explanations, no\nconsensus has yet been reached. Most previous studies have focused on high-mass\nclusters. In this work, we extend the analysis to the less-explored low-mass\nregime by investigating star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds using data from\nthe VISCACHA survey. We employed a widely used method to quantify the MSTO\nwidth in terms of age spread. Additionally, to validate our approach, we used a\ncluster also observed with HST. Our analysis confirms that the eMSTO phenomenon\nis also present in low-mass clusters, following the known age/mass-MSTO width\nrelations. In particular, the less massive cluster in our sample does not show\nan eMSTO, supporting the proposed link between the eMSTO and the escape\nvelocity of the cluster, providing a new lower limit to the age spread of\n$88\\pm40$ Myr for the presence of the eMSTO. The consistent MSTO width\nmeasurements between the VISCACHA and HST photometries confirm the robustness\nof our method and demonstrate that the age spread determination is independent\nof the photometric system, showing also the power of ground-based observations\nto investigate the eMSTO phenomenon.\n",
