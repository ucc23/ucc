      "title": "Hydrodynamic simulations of black hole evolution in AGN discs I: orbital\n  alignment of highly inclined satellites",
      "summary": "  The frequency of compact object interactions in AGN discs is naturally tied\nto the number of objects embedded within it. We investigate the evolution of\nblack holes in the nuclear stellar cluster on inclined orbits to the AGN disc\nby performing adiabatic hydrodynamical simulations of isolated black hole disc\ncrossings over a range of disc densities and inclinations\n$i\\in[2^\\circ,15^\\circ]$. We find radiation dominates the pressure in the wake\nthat forms around the BH across the full inclination and disc density range. We\nidentify no well defined steady state wake morphology due to the thin geometry\nof the disc and the vertical exponential density drop off, where the wake\nmorphology depends on the vertical depth of the transit within the disc. The\ninclination damping $\\Delta i$ relative the pre-transit inclination behaves as\na power law in $\\sin(i)$ and the ambient Hill mass $m_\\text{H,0}$ as $\\Delta\ni/i \\propto m_{\\rm H,0}^{0.4} \\sin(i)^{-2.7}$. The drag on the BH is dominated\nby the gravity of the wake for the majority of our inclination range until\naccretion effects become comparable at $\\sin(i)\\gtrsim30H_0/R_0$, where\n$H_0/R_0$ is the disc aspect ratio. At low inclinations\n($\\sin(i)\\lesssim3H_0/R_0$) the wake morphology becomes more spherical, leading\nto a regime change in the inclination damping behaviour. Our results suggest\nthat the inclination damping timescale is shorter than expected from only\nepisodic Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttelton accretion events during each transit, implying\ninclined objects may captured by the AGN disc earlier in its lifetime than\npreviously thought.\n",

      "title": "Stellar Mass Segregation in Dark Matter Halos",
      "summary": "  We study the effect of stellar mass segregation driven by collisional\nrelaxation within the potential well of a smooth dark matter halo. This effect\nis of particular relevance for old stellar systems with short crossing times,\nwhere small collisional perturbations accumulate over many dynamical time\nscales. We run collisional $N$-body simulations tailored to the ambiguous\nstellar systems Ursa Major 3/Unions 1, Delve 1 and Eridanus 3, modelling their\nstellar populations as two-component systems of high- and low-mass stars,\nrespectively. For Ursa Major 3/Unions 1 (Delve 1), assuming a\ndynamical-to-stellar mass ratio of 10, we find that after 10 Gyr of evolution,\nthe radial extent of its low-mass stars will be twice as large (40 per cent\nlarger) than that of its high-mass stars. We show that weak tides do not alter\nthis relative separation of half-light radii, whereas for the case of strong\ntidal fields, mass segregation facilitates the tidal stripping of low-mass\nstars. We further find that as the population of high-mass stars contracts and\ncools, the number of dynamically formed binaries within that population\nincreases. Our results call for caution when using stellar mass segregation as\na criterion to separate star clusters from dwarf galaxies, and suggest that\nmass segregation increases the abundance of massive binaries in the central\nregions of dark matter-dominated dwarf galaxies.\n",

      "title": "Spectral Evolution of Rotating Population III Stars",
      "summary": "  Population III (Pop III) stars, the first generation of stars formed from\nprimordial gas, played a fundamental role in shaping the early universe through\ntheir influence on cosmic reionization, early chemical enrichment, and the\nformation of the first galaxies. However, to date they have eluded direct\ndetection due to their short lifetimes and high redshifts. The launch of the\nJames Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revolutionized observational\ncapabilities, providing the opportunity to detect Pop~III stars via caustic\nlensing, where strong gravitational lensing magnifies individual stars to\nobservable levels. This prospect makes it compelling to develop accurate models\nfor their spectral characteristics to distinguish them from other stellar\npopulations. Previous studies have focused on computing the spectral properties\nof non-rotating, zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) Pop III stars. In this work, we\nexpand upon these efforts by incorporating the effects of stellar rotation and\npost-ZAMS evolution into spectral calculations. We use the JWST bands and\nmagnitude limits to identify the optimal observing conditions, both for\nisolated stars, as well as for small star clusters. We find that, while\nrotation does not appreciably change the observability at ZAMS, the subsequent\nevolution can significantly brighten the stars, making the most massive ones\npotentially visible with only moderate lensing.\n",

      "summary": "  We apply population synthesis techniques to analyze TYPHOON long slit spectra\nof the starburst barred spiral galaxy M83. The analysis covers a central square\nof 5 arcmin side length. We determine the spatial distribution of dust through\nthe analysis of reddening and extinction, together with star formation rates,\nages, and metallicities of young and old stellar populations. For the first\ntime, a spatial one-to-one comparison of metallicities derived from\nfull-spectral fitting techniques with those obtained from individual young\nstellar probes has been carried out. The comparison with blue supergiant stars,\nyoung massive star clusters, and super star clusters shows a high degree of\nconcordance when wavelength coverage in the $B$-band is available. The\nmetallicity of the young population is supersolar and does not show a radial\nmetallicity gradient along the investigated part of the disk, in agreement with\nour chemical evolution model. However, a notable decrease in metallicity is\nobserved in a tightly confined region at the galaxy center, coinciding with\ncircumnuclear orbits. We attribute this to matter infall either from the\ncircumgalactic medium or a dwarf galaxy interloper or, alternatively, to\nAGN-interrupted chemical evolution. We confirm the presence of a dust cavity\nwith a diameter of 260~pc close to the galaxy center. Dust absorption and\nmolecular CO emission are spatially well correlated. We find an anticorrelation\nbetween R$_V$, the ratio of dust attenuation to reddening, and the emission\nstrength of molecular species present in photo-dissociation regions. We confirm\nour results by using alternative fitting algorithms and stellar libraries.\n",

      "summary": "  Young star clusters can inherit bulk rotation from the molecular clouds from\nwhich they have formed. This rotation can affect the long-term evolution of a\nstar cluster and its constituent stellar populations. In this study, we aim to\ncharacterize the effects of different degrees of initial rotation on star\nclusters with primordial binaries. The simulations are performed using\nNBODY6++GPU. We find that initial rotation strongly affects the early evolution\nof star clusters. Rapidly rotating clusters show angular momentum transport\nfrom the inner parts to the outskirts, resulting in a core collapse. Angular\nmomentum transport is accompanied by a highly elongated bar-like structure\nmorphology. The effects of bulk rotation are reduced on the timescale of\ntwo-body relaxation. Rotating and non-rotating clusters experience changes in\nthe direction of angular momentum near the dissolution and early evolution due\nto the tidal field, respectively. We present synthetic observations of\nsimulated clusters for comparison with future observations in filters of Gaia,\nCSST, and HST. This work shows the effects of bulk rotation on systems with\nprimordial binaries and could be used for the identification of rotation\nsignatures in observed open clusters.\n",

      "summary": "  The origin of supermassive black holes is an open question that has been\nexplored considering gas- and collision-based formation channels to explain the\nhigh number of quasars observed in the early Universe. According to numerical\nsimulations, supermassive stars can be formed in atomic cooling halos when\nprotostars reach accretion rates greater than $\\sim\n10^{-2}~\\mathrm{M_{\\odot}~yr^{-1}}$ and fragmentation is inhibited on parsec\nscales. It remains uncertain, however, whether fragmentation on smaller scales\nleads to the formation of a star cluster instead of a supermassive star in the\npresence of possible cooling mechanisms. We explored the formation of a central\nmassive object through collisions and the accretion of Population III stars in\na primordial gas cloud in a gravitationally unstable system by varying the gas\ntemperature and the degree of gravitational instability. We performed\nmultiphysics simulations in the AMUSE framework with a hydrodynamical gas\ntreatment through Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics and $N$-body dynamics for the\nprotostars represented through sink particles. Our results show that central\nmassive objects with masses $\\sim 10^4~\\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$ can be formed by\naccretion and collisions at different temperatures and that the most massive\nobject can reach efficiencies of $\\sim 0.61$ for atomic cooling conditions and\n$\\sim 0.95$ for more unstable conditions. We observe a quasi-disk formation for\nwarmer temperatures and a higher contribution through collisions to the mass of\na central massive object. Our results show that the embedded cluster is in a\nsupercompetitive accretion regime in which it obtains mass by accretion that is\nregulated by self-gravity. Our results suggest that in more unstable conditions\nwith lower gas temperatures, a more massive supermassive black hole seed can\nform.\n",
