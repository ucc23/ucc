    "title": "850 SRG/eROSITA X-ray sources associated with Pleiades stars",
    "summary": "  Using data from the SRG/eROSITA all-sky X-ray survey and the GAIA-based\ncatalog of 2,209 members of the Pleiades open star cluster, we found 850 X-ray\nsources associated with the cluster stars. Over 650 of them were detected in\nX-rays for the first time. At the distance of the Pleiades, the nominal\nsensitivity of eROSITA corresponds to a luminosity of $L_X \\sim 1.6 \\cdot\n10^{28}$ erg/s in the 0.3-2.3 keV band. The eROSITA sources associated with\nPleiades stars have a total luminosity of $L_{X,tot} \\sim 1.3 \\cdot 10^{32}$\nerg/s , a million times greater than the X-ray luminosity of the quiet Sun.\nStrong X-ray variability, more than 10 times, was recorded for 27 sources. Most\nof them are known as eruptive optical variables of the dM class. The value of\n$R_X=log(L_X/L_{bol})$ increases with decreasing effective temperature of the\nstar from $R_X\\approx -5$ to $R_X\\approx -2$. The distribution of stars over\n$R_X$ is bimodal, with the left peak at $R_X\\sim-4.3$ being formed by stars of\nFGK classes, and the right peak at $R_X\\sim-3.1$ being mainly populated by\nM-stars. The relation between $R_X$ and the Rossby number $Ro$ depends on the\nspectral class. For K- and M- stars, at low Rossby numbers $R_X\\sim -3$ and\ndepends weakly on $Ro$. At $Ro \\gt 0.25$, a rapid drop in $R_X$ is observed for\nK stars, while in our sample there are no M stars with large Rossby number.\nMost of F- and G- stars appear to have smaller $R_X\\sim -4.5$, however, our\nsample size is insufficient for a more detailed characterization of their\n$R_X-Ro$ dependence.\n",

    "title": "Constraining the environment of compact binary mergers with self-lensing\n  signatures",
    "summary": "  Gravitational waves (GWs) from coalescing binary black holes (BBHs) can come\nfrom different environments. GWs interact gravitationally with astrophysical\nobjects, which makes it possible to use gravitational lensing by nearby objects\n(self-lensing) to learn about their environments. We quantify the probability\nof self-lensing through the optical depth $\\tau$ for the main channels of\ndetectable GWs at frequencies $f_{\\rm GW}\\sim (1-10^3)\\,{\\rm Hz}$. We then\nanalyze the detectability of the lensing effect (imprint). In star clusters,\nthe probability of self-lensing by stellar-mass black holes (BHs) is low\n($\\tau\\simeq10^{-7}$), even when taking into account nearby BHs in resonant\ninteractions ($\\tau\\simeq 10^{-5}$). Additionally, the lensing imprint of a\nstellar-mass lens (diffraction and interference) is too marginal to be\ndetectable by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detectors and most Einstein Telescope\nsignals. For a massive BH lens in the center of a cluster, the probability can\nreach $\\tau\\simeq 10^{-4}$ either via von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai induced mergers of\nBBHs orbiting a central massive BH or BBHs formed as GW captures in\nsingle-single interactions in the Bahcall-Wolf cusp of a nuclear cluster,\nlikely eccentric. For self-lensing by a supermassive BH for BBHs in the\nmigration trap of an AGN (active galactic nucleus) disk, $\\tau \\simeq 10^{-2}$.\nThe imprint of these massive lenses are two images that are easily detectable\nalready in current detectors. Moreover, AGN disk merger signals have a distinct\nlinear $h_+$ polarization. The probability depends on the extent of the\ndetectability through the threshold impact parameter $y_{\\rm max}$, which can\nincrease for future detectors. We conclude that constraining the environment of\nBBHs is possible by combining self-lensing imprints with other waveform\nsignatures such as eccentricity and polarization.\n",
