    "title": "Rapid formation of a very massive star >50000 $M_\\odot$ and subsequently\n  an IMBH from runaway collisions. Direct N-body and Monte Carlo simulations of\n  dense star clusters",
    "summary": "  Context. We present simulations of a massive young star cluster using\n\\textsc{Nbody6++GPU} and \\textsc{MOCCA}. The cluster is initially more compact\nthan previously published models, with one million stars, a total mass of $5.86\n\\times 10^5~\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$, and a half-mass radius of $0.1~\\mathrm{pc}$.\n  Aims. We analyse the formation and growth of a very massive star (VMS)\nthrough successive stellar collisions and investigate the subsequent formation\nof an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) in the core of a dense star cluster.\n  Methods. We use both direct \\textit{N}-body and Monte Carlo simulations,\nincorporating updated stellar evolution prescriptions (SSE/BSE) tailored to\nmassive stars and VMSs. These include revised treatments of stellar radii,\nrejuvenation, and mass loss during collisions. While the prescriptions\nrepresent reasonable extrapolations into the VMS regime, the internal structure\nand thermal state of VMSs formed through stellar collisions remain uncertain,\nand future work may require further refinement.\n  Results. We find that runaway stellar collisions in the cluster core produce\na VMS exceeding $5 \\times 10^4~\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ within 5 Myr, which\nsubsequently collapses into an IMBH.\n  Conclusions. Our model suggests that dense stellar environments may enable\nthe formation of very massive stars and massive black hole seeds through\nrunaway stellar collisions. These results provide a potential pathway for early\nblack hole growth in star clusters and offer theoretical context for\ninterpreting recent JWST observations of young, compact clusters at high\nredshift.\n",

    "title": "SIEGE IV: compact star clusters in cosmological simulations with high\n  star formation efficiency and sub-parsec resolution",
    "summary": "  The formation of compact high-redshift star-forming clumps, the physical\nprocesses driving their evolution and their potential connection to present-day\nGlobular Clusters are key open questions in galaxy formation. In this work, we\naim to shed light on these aspects using the SImulating the Environment where\nGlobular clusters Emerged (SIEGE) project, a suite of cosmological zoom-in\nsimulations with sub-parsec resolution specifically designed to investigate the\nphysical conditions behind the origin of compact stellar systems in\nhigh-redshift environments. The simulation object of this study focuses on a\ndwarf galaxy with a virial mass of a few $10^9$ $M_\\odot$ at $z=6.14$, where\nthe spatial resolution reaches 0.3 pc $h^{-1}$. Individual stars are formed\ndirectly by sampling the initial mass function with a 100\\% star formation\nefficiency, a setup designed to explore the impact of a high star formation\nefficiency under high-redshift conditions. The simulation reveals the emergence\nof numerous stellar clumps with sizes of 1-3 pc, stellar surface densities up\nto almost $10^4$ $M_\\odot$ pc$^{-2}$, and masses predominantly spanning from\n$10^3$ $M_\\odot$ to several $10^4$ $M_\\odot$, with a few reaching $10^5$\n$M_\\odot$ and up to $10^6$ $M_\\odot$. All clumps form during intense, short\nbursts of star formation lasting less than a Myr, often with negligible dark\nmatter content (dark-to-stellar mass ratios below 1 within three times their\neffective radii). We measure a clear correlation between mass and size, and a\nclump mass function described by a power-law with a slope of -2. Star formation\nconditions in the simulation behave similarly to those of a feedback-free\nstarburst scenario, where dense clumps form due to inefficient stellar feedback\nover small timescales. Notably, some clumps exhibit properties closely\nresembling those of present-day globular clusters.\n",

    "title": "Disruptions of stars and binary systems on chaotic orbits in the\n  axisymmetric Milky Way center",
    "summary": "  Non-spherical potentials allow a wide range of trajectories, both regular and\nchaotic, whose periapse distances can vary orbit to orbit. In particular\nchaotic trajectories can bring a system arbitrarily close to the central\nmassive black hole leading to a disruption. In this paper, we work with an\nobservationally benchmarked model of the innermost 200 pc of the Milky Way and\nshow that low z-angular momentum trajectories are commonly chaotic. We compute\nthe timescales and properties of close pericenter passages, and compare the\nimplied collisionless disruption rate to the well-studied collisional rate from\n2-body scatterings. We find that the relative collisionless rate can dominate\nby orders of magnitude. Our calculations are relevant for a wide range of\ndisruption phenomena, including the production of hypervelocity stars (HVSs)\nand tidal disruption events (TDEs). Most of these disruptions involve stars\ncome from the Nuclear Stellar Cluster, with a pericenter distribution that\nstrongly favours shallow encounters, and a preference for high inclination\ninteractions. The latter implies that unbound disrupted material - whether\nejected stars or stellar debris - would be preferentially directed towards the\ngalactic poles. Many of our conclusions apply generally to any galaxy with a\nnon-spherical galactic centre potential and central massive black hole.\n",

    "summary": "  Using data from the SRG/eROSITA all-sky X-ray survey and the GAIA-based\ncatalog of 2,209 members of the Pleiades open star cluster, we found 850 X-ray\nsources associated with the cluster stars. Over 650 of them were detected in\nX-rays for the first time. At the distance of the Pleiades, the nominal\nsensitivity of eROSITA corresponds to a luminosity of $L_X \\sim 1.6 \\cdot\n10^{28}$ erg/s in the 0.3-2.3 keV band. The eROSITA sources associated with\nPleiades stars have a total luminosity of $L_{X,tot} \\sim 1.3 \\cdot 10^{32}$\nerg/s , a million times greater than the X-ray luminosity of the quiet Sun.\nStrong X-ray variability, more than 10 times, was recorded for 27 sources. Most\nof them are known as eruptive optical variables of the dM class. The value of\n$R_X=log(L_X/L_{bol})$ increases with decreasing effective temperature of the\nstar from $R_X\\approx -5$ to $R_X\\approx -2$. The distribution of stars over\n$R_X$ is bimodal, with the left peak at $R_X\\sim-4.3$ being formed by stars of\nFGK classes, and the right peak at $R_X\\sim-3.1$ being mainly populated by\nM-stars. The relation between $R_X$ and the Rossby number $Ro$ depends on the\nspectral class. For K- and M- stars, at low Rossby numbers $R_X\\sim -3$ and\ndepends weakly on $Ro$. At $Ro \\gt 0.25$, a rapid drop in $R_X$ is observed for\nK stars, while in our sample there are no M stars with large Rossby number.\nMost of F- and G- stars appear to have smaller $R_X\\sim -4.5$, however, our\nsample size is insufficient for a more detailed characterization of their\n$R_X-Ro$ dependence.\n",

    "title": "Constraining the environment of compact binary mergers with self-lensing\n  signatures",
    "summary": "  Gravitational waves (GWs) from coalescing binary black holes (BBHs) can come\nfrom different environments. GWs interact gravitationally with astrophysical\nobjects, which makes it possible to use gravitational lensing by nearby objects\n(self-lensing) to learn about their environments. We quantify the probability\nof self-lensing through the optical depth $\\tau$ for the main channels of\ndetectable GWs at frequencies $f_{\\rm GW}\\sim (1-10^3)\\,{\\rm Hz}$. We then\nanalyze the detectability of the lensing effect (imprint). In star clusters,\nthe probability of self-lensing by stellar-mass black holes (BHs) is low\n($\\tau\\simeq10^{-7}$), even when taking into account nearby BHs in resonant\ninteractions ($\\tau\\simeq 10^{-5}$). Additionally, the lensing imprint of a\nstellar-mass lens (diffraction and interference) is too marginal to be\ndetectable by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detectors and most Einstein Telescope\nsignals. For a massive BH lens in the center of a cluster, the probability can\nreach $\\tau\\simeq 10^{-4}$ either via von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai induced mergers of\nBBHs orbiting a central massive BH or BBHs formed as GW captures in\nsingle-single interactions in the Bahcall-Wolf cusp of a nuclear cluster,\nlikely eccentric. For self-lensing by a supermassive BH for BBHs in the\nmigration trap of an AGN (active galactic nucleus) disk, $\\tau \\simeq 10^{-2}$.\nThe imprint of these massive lenses are two images that are easily detectable\nalready in current detectors. Moreover, AGN disk merger signals have a distinct\nlinear $h_+$ polarization. The probability depends on the extent of the\ndetectability through the threshold impact parameter $y_{\\rm max}$, which can\nincrease for future detectors. We conclude that constraining the environment of\nBBHs is possible by combining self-lensing imprints with other waveform\nsignatures such as eccentricity and polarization.\n",
