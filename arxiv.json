      "title": "The systemic recoil velocity distribution and the scale height of\n  isolated millisecond pulsar systems: Implications on neutron star retention\n  fractions in star clusters",
      "summary": "  The systemic recoil velocity ($v_\\mathrm{sys}$) distribution of millisecond\npulsars (MSPs) is essential for understanding the MSP formation and estimating\nthe retention fractions of MSPs in star clusters, which can potentially be\ndetermined with astrometric studies that take into account MSPs' long-term\ndynamic evolution and the scarcity of radial velocity measurements. We compiled\n65 isolated (or field) MSP systems (including lone MSPs) that are well\nastrometrically determined, and calculated their transverse peculiar (or space)\nvelocities $\\boldsymbol{v}_\\perp$ and Galactic heights $z$. We find that the\nobserved Galactic-longitude components $v_\\mathrm{l}$ of $\\boldsymbol{v}_\\perp$\ncan be well described by a linear combination of three normal distributions.\nAssuming that 1) $v_\\mathrm{l}$ are statistically stable over time (the\n\"stable-$v_\\mathrm{l}$\" assumption), and 2) $\\boldsymbol{v}_\\mathrm{sys}$\ndirections are uniformly distributed (the\n\"isotropic-$\\boldsymbol{v}_\\mathrm{sys}$\" assumption), the MSP $v_\\mathrm{sys}$\ndistribution can be approximated by a linear combination of three Maxwellian\ncomponents. Our dynamical population synthesis analysis based on the derived\n$v_\\mathrm{sys}$ distribution verified the \"stable-$v_\\mathrm{l}$\" assumption\nin the parameter space of this work, and estimated the initial and the current\nGalaxy-wide scale heights of isolated MSP systems to be about 0.32 kpc and 0.66\nkpc, respectively. According to the MSP $v_\\mathrm{sys}$ distribution,\n$\\sim13$% of all the MSPs born in a globular cluster (GC) with the nominal 50\n$\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$ central escape velocity can be retained. Therefore, the\n$v_\\mathrm{sys}$ distribution of isolated MSP systems may account for the high\nnumber of MSPs discovered in GCs, which implies that MSPs in star clusters may\nfollow the same formation channel(s) as isolated MSP systems.\n",

      "title": "Structural parameters, chronological age and dynamical age of the LMC\n  globular cluster NGC 1754",
      "summary": "  In the context of a new systematic study of the properties of the most\ncompact and massive star clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), here we\npresent the determination of the chronological age, the structural parameters,\nand the dynamical age of NGC 1754. We used high-resolution images taken with\nthe WFC3/HST instrument, both in optical and near-ultraviolet filters. The high\nquality of the images made it possible to construct the star density profile\nfrom resolved star counts, and to fit the observed profile with an appropriate\nKing model to obtain the structural parameters (e.g. core, half-mass, and tidal\nradii). Our findings confirm that NGC 1754 is a very compact globular cluster\nwith a core radius of only 0.84 pc. The analysis of the same dataset allowed us\nto confirm a very old age ($t=12.8\\pm0.4$ Gyr) for this system, thus further\nconsolidating the indication that the process of globular cluster formation\nstarted at the same cosmic time both in the LMC and in the Milky Way,\nindependently of the characteristics of the host environment. We have also used\nthe empirical method called ``dynamical clock'' to estimate the dynamical age\nof the system. This consists of quantifying the degree of central segregation\nof blue straggler stars (BSSs) using the $A^+_{rh}$ parameter, which is defined\nas the area enclosed between the cumulative radial distribution of BSSs and\nthat of a reference (lighter) population. This method yielded a value of\n$A^+_{rh}=0.31\\pm0.07$, which is the highest measured so far for LMC clusters,\npointing to an advanced dynamical age for the cluster, possibly on the verge of\ncore collapse. The results presented here for NGC 1754 confirm that the natural\ndynamical evolution of globular clusters plays a role in shaping the age-core\nradius distributions observed in the LMC.\n",

      "summary": "  Numerical simulations predict that clumps ($\\sim$1 pc) should form stars at\nhigh efficiency to produce bound star clusters. We conducted a statistical\nstudy of 17 nearby cluster-forming clumps to examine the star formation rate\nand gas mass surface density relations (i.e. $\\Sigma_{\\rm{SFR}}$ vs.\n$\\Sigma_{\\rm{gas}}$) at the clump scale. Using near-infrared point sources and\nHerschel dust continuum analysis, we obtained the radius, age, and stellar mass\nfor most clusters in the ranges 0.5$-$1.6 pc, 0.5$-$1.5 Myr, 40$-$500\nM$_\\odot$, respectively, and also found that they are associated with\n$\\Sigma_{\\rm{gas}}$ values ranging from 80$-$600 M$_\\odot$ pc$^{-2}$. We\nobtained the best-fit scaling relations as $\\Sigma_{\\rm{SFR}}$ $\\propto$\n$\\Sigma_{\\rm{gas}}^{1.46}$ and $\\Sigma_{\\rm{SFR}}$ $\\propto$\n$(\\Sigma_{\\rm{gas}}/t_{\\rm{ff}})^{0.80}$ for the studied sample of clumps.\nComparing our results with existing scaling relations at cloud and\nextragalactic scales, we found that while the power-law exponent obtained in\nthis work is similar to those found at these scales, the star formation rate\nsurface densities are relatively higher for similar gas mass surface densities.\nFrom this work, we obtained instantaneous median star formation efficiency\n(SFE) and efficiency per free-fall time ($\\epsilon_{\\rm{ff}}$) of $\\sim$20% and\n$\\sim$13%, respectively, for the studied clumps. We discuss the cause of the\nobtained high SFE and $\\epsilon_{\\rm{ff}}$ in the studied clumps and also\ndiscuss the results in the context of bound cluster formation within molecular\nclouds. We conclude that our results do not favour a universal scaling law with\na constant value of $\\epsilon_{\\rm{ff}}$ in star-forming systems across\ndifferent scales.\n",

In\nthis study, high-resolution near-infrared spectroscopic data of seven giant\nstars from the Trumpler 5 cluster were analyzed to derive chemical abundances\nfor 20 elements and $^{12}C/^{13}C$ ratios. Color-magnitude diagram (CMD)\nanalysis of BV and Gaia photometry has also been performed for a comprehensive\nstudy of the cluster. Thanks to the methodology employed, some targets are\nstudied for the first time. Additionally, it provides a detailed\ncolor-magnitude diagram analysis using photometric and spectroscopic data. We\ngathered high-resolution spectra for seven Trumpler 5 red giants in the\nnear-infrared H and K wavelength domains, using the Immersion Grating INfrared\nSpectrometer (IGRINS). We introduced a method to initially estimate the stellar\nsurface gravity (log g) by using calibrated equivalent widths of the Ti II line\nat 15873 {\\AA} from a large sample. We performed standard spectroscopic\nanalyses to refine the model atmospheric parameters of our targets and\ndetermined the chemical abundances primarily through spectrum synthesis. We\nalso performed color-magnitude diagram analyses to extract differential\nreddening correction to compare cluster parameters both with and without\ncorrections. We derived stellar parameters for seven members of Trumpler 5 with\nour method and the results are consistent with both the literature and other\nmethods. We also inferred elemental abundances for more than 20 species, along\nwith the $^{12}C/^{13}C$ ratios. The elemental abundances are in good agreement\nwith the literature values for similar targets. Through CMD analysis, we found\nthe reddening value, E(B-V)$\\simeq$0.76 and estimated the age of the cluster to\nbe approximately 2.50 Gyr.\n",

      "summary": "  Multiplicity among massive stars represents a major uncertainty in stellar\nevolution theory, because the extra physical processes that it introduces\nsignificantly impacts each star's structure. While multiplicity of O-type stars\nis fairly well constrained, for B-type stars it is not. B-type stars are more\ncommon and have longer lifetimes, thus providing an opportunity to characterize\nmultiplicity at different ages. Moreover, young open clusters are advantageous\nfor studying coeval and chemically homogeneous environments. Using a\nmulti-epoch spectroscopic campaign with the HERMES spectrograph we determine\nmultiplicity properties and rotation rates of 74 B-type stars in four Galactic\nopen clusters: $h$ and $\\chi$ Persei, NGC 457, NGC 581, and NGC 1960. We\nmeasure radial velocities with a cross-correlation method and determine\ntentative orbital solutions for 26 of the 28 identified binaries. We detect\nseveral Be stars, five of them being members of binary systems. We correct the\nobserved binary fractions for observational biases and determine an average\nintrinsic binary fraction of 79$_{-16}^{+19}\\%$. The consistency in binary\nfraction among the four clusters, which are between 15 and 30 Myr, suggests a\nreasonably homogenous binary fraction across this age range. We used TLUSTY\natmosphere models to determine the projected rotational velocities, with an\naverage value of 240 km s$^{-1}$ for both single and binary systems. Whereas,\nthe Be stars show higher velocities between 200 and 360 km s$^{-1}$.\n",

      "title": "FEAST: JWST uncovers the emerging timescales of young star clusters in\n  M83",
      "summary": "  We present JWST NIRCam observations of the emerging young star clusters\n(eYSCs) detected in the nearby spiral galaxy M83. The NIRcam mosaic encompasses\nthe nuclear starburst, the bar, and the inner spiral arms. The eYSCs, detected\nin Pa$\\alpha$ and Br$\\alpha$ maps, have been largely missed in previous optical\ncampaigns of young star clusters (YSCs). We distinguish between eYSCI, if they\nalso have compact 3.3~$\\mu$m PAH emission associated to them, and eYSCII, if\nthey only appear as compact Pa$\\alpha$ emitters. We find that the variations in\nthe 3.3~$\\mu$m PAH feature are consistent with an evolutionary sequence where\neYSCI evolve into eYSCII and then optical YSCs. This sequence is clear in the\nF300M-F335M (tracing the excess in the \\PAHlambda\\ feature) and the F115W-F187N\n(tracing the excess in Pa$\\alpha$) colors which become increasingly bluer as\nclusters emerge. The central starburst stands out as the region where the most\nmassive eYSCs are currently forming in the galaxy. We estimate that only about\n20~\\% of the eYSCs will remain detectable as compact YSCs. Combining eYSCs and\nYSCs ($\\leq$10 Myr) we recover an average clearing timescale of 6~Myr in which\nclusters transition from embedded to fully exposed. We see evidence of shorter\nemergence timescales ($\\sim$5~Myr) for more massive ($>5\\times10^3$ \\msun)\nclusters, while star clusters of $\\sim 10^3$ \\msun\\ about 7~Myr. We estimate\nthat eYSCs remain associated to the \\PAHlambda\\ emission 3--4~Myr. Larger\nsamples of eYSC and YSC populations will provide stronger statistics to further\ntest environmental and cluster mass dependencies on the emergence timescale.\n",

      "summary": "  Context. We present simulations of a massive young star cluster using\n\\textsc{Nbody6++GPU} and \\textsc{MOCCA}. The cluster is initially more compact\nthan previously published models, with one million stars, a total mass of $5.86\n\\times 10^5~\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$, and a half-mass radius of $0.1~\\mathrm{pc}$.\n  Aims. We analyse the formation and growth of a very massive star (VMS)\nthrough successive stellar collisions and investigate the subsequent formation\nof an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) in the core of a dense star cluster.\n  Methods. We use both direct \\textit{N}-body and Monte Carlo simulations,\nincorporating updated stellar evolution prescriptions (SSE/BSE) tailored to\nmassive stars and VMSs. These include revised treatments of stellar radii,\nrejuvenation, and mass loss during collisions. While the prescriptions\nrepresent reasonable extrapolations into the VMS regime, the internal structure\nand thermal state of VMSs formed through stellar collisions remain uncertain,\nand future work may require further refinement.\n  Results. We find that runaway stellar collisions in the cluster core produce\na VMS exceeding $5 \\times 10^4~\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ within 5 Myr, which\nsubsequently collapses into an IMBH.\n  Conclusions. Our model suggests that dense stellar environments may enable\nthe formation of very massive stars and massive black hole seeds through\nrunaway stellar collisions. These results provide a potential pathway for early\nblack hole growth in star clusters and offer theoretical context for\ninterpreting recent JWST observations of young, compact clusters at high\nredshift.\n",
